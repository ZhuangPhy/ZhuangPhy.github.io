<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>We consider the transport properties of a model of fermions scattered by a critical bosonic mode. The mode is overdamped and scattering is mainly in the forward direction. Such a mode appears at the quantum critical point for a electronic nematic phase transition, and in gauge theories for a U(1) spin liquid. It leads to a short fermion life-time, violating Landau's criterion for a Fermi liquid. In spite of this, transport can be described by a Boltzmann equation. We include momentum relaxation by umklapp scattering, supplemented by weak impurity scattering. We find that above a very low temperature which scales with <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q}^{3},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q}\)</span> is the minimum umklapp scattering vector, the resistivity is linear in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> with a coefficient which is independent of the amount of disorder. We compare the relaxation time approximation with an exact numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation. Surprisingly we find that unlike the resistivity, the Hall Coefficient strongly deviates from the relaxation time approximation and shows a strong reduction with increasing temperature. We comment on possible comparisons with experiments on high <span class="math inline">\(T_{c}\)</span> Cuprates.</p>

<p>A great deal of attention has been paid to the linear in temperature resistivity observed in the Cuprate high temperature superconductor family, in the so-called strange metal phase. (For a recent discussion with up to date references, see [1].) A T-linear resistivity is not unusual on its own: the standard electron phonon scattering leads to linear in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> resistivity at temperatures above approximate <span class="math inline">\(1 / 4\)</span> of the Debye temperature.</p>
<p>What is <strong>surprising</strong> are two addition features.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, the linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> term often extends to low temperatures of a few Kelvin or even less, if the superconductivity is suppressed by a strong magnetic field. There are experiments that show that this low temperature linear term extends over a range of doping, albeit with a <strong>doping dependent</strong> slope that may or may not match the high temperature slope. [2,3]</li>
<li>A second feature is that at some special doping, the linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> term <strong>persists over a large temperature range</strong> with the same slope all the way to the lowest temperature.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this paper we shall not address this second feature, but instead focus on the low temperature linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> phenomenon, which is highly unusual on its own, because the standard expectation is <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> behavior. It is therefore important to ask whether there is a microscopic model that gives rise to the low temperature linear in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> resistivity.</p>

<p>In this paper we consider a model which assumes a two dimensional Fermi sea where the fermions with dispersion <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }\)</span> are being scattered by a critical bosonic mode with the propagator <span class="math inline">\(P(q, \omega)=1 /\left(C q^{2}-i \omega / q\right)\)</span> so that the spectral function <span class="math inline">\(D(q, \omega)=\operatorname{Im}[P(q, \omega)]\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[
D(q, \omega)=\frac{q \omega}{\omega^{2}+\left(C q^{3}\right)^{2}} \tag{1}
\]</span> To simplify notations, throughout this paper we measure energy, temperature or frequency in units of the nearest neighbor fermion hopping parameter <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and we set the lattice constant to be unity. The fermions are scattered by this mode with a coupling constant <span class="math inline">\(g .\)</span> Equation (1) has arisen in several contexts.</p>
<p>For example, this equation describes the critical fluctuations at a quantum critical point that separates a Fermi surface with four-fold symmetry to one with two-fold symmetry. This is sometimes called the <strong>electronic nematic phase transition</strong> or the <strong>Pomeranchuk instability</strong>. This model is considered to be one of the <strong>leading candidates</strong> for a quantum critical point in the Cuprates. Nematicity is also known to play a prominent role in the iron based superconductors.[4] It is also worth noting that nematicity, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -linear resistivity and van Hove singularity are ingredients that are showing up in twisted bilayer graphene as well. [5] Importantly, the singularity is for small momentum <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\([6-8]\)</span> This is very different from a charge or spin density wave or an antiferromagnetic instability, where the singularity occurs at a finite <span class="math inline">\(q .[9,10]\)</span></p>
<p>Another example is the scattering of fermionic spinons by <span class="math inline">\(U (1)\)</span> gauge fluctuations that arise in spin-charge separated models in certain quantum spin liquids. [11] This model has also been discussed in the composite fermion description of the half-filled Landau level. [12] The <span class="math inline">\(\omega / q\)</span> term in the propagator <span class="math inline">\(P(q, \omega)\)</span> comes from Landau damping of the mode by the Fermi sea. The mode is over-damped with <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> that scales as <span class="math inline">\(q^{3}\)</span>. This leads to a fermion self energy <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(\omega)\)</span> that goes in leading order as <span class="math inline">\(\omega^{2 / 3}\)</span>, thereby violating the Landau criterion for a well defined quasi-particle. [11] As a result, this model is considered to be an example of a <strong>non-Fermi liquid</strong>.</p>
<p>We have earlier suggested that this model gives rise to a transport scattering rate that goes as <span class="math inline">\(T^{4 / 3}\)</span>. [11] This was based on the assumption that the bosonic mode equilibrates to the lattice, but this assumption has been rightly criticized on the grounds that the total momentum is conserved in the scattering process and therefore there is no mechanism for relaxing the current. [7,8] Some form of momentum relaxation such as disorder or umklapp scattering needs to be introduced. Ref. [7] considered impurity scattering and concluded that the leading T dependent correction for a singly connected convex <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> Fermi surface has a power greater than 2 and saturate for higher temperatures. In ref. [8],the problem was worked out for several versions of disorder including a linear coupling to the nematic order parameter. In this paper we focus on umklapp scattering as the mechanism of momentum relaxation. The motivation is the following. In the Cuprates, the Fermi level is close to a van Hove singularity so that the minimum umklapp vector <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q}\)</span> connecting neighboring Fermi surfaces is small near the antinode, as seen in fig 1. Due to the <span class="math inline">\(q^{3}\)</span> scaling in Eq. <span class="math inline">\(1,\)</span> the temperature scale when the umklapp scattering kicks in can be very low, being proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q}^{3}\)</span> It will be interesting to find out what the resistivity is above this low temperature scale. A more general remark is that because the mode is overdamped, the umklapp effect is not exponentially small at low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> as in the case of electron-phonon interaction, but will in general be power-law down to the lowest temperature. As we shall show, what we find is a <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> behavior that crosses over to <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> at a very low temperature scale. To see how this come about, we make a quick estimate of the scattering rate <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span> of a fermion at the umklapp point <span class="math inline">\((\theta=0)\)</span> with energy <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> by emitting a boson mode with momentum <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> to reach a final state at <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> on the umklapp Fermi surface, a seen in the inset of Fig. 1 <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{\gamma} \approx \int_{0}^{\infty} d \omega \int d \phi\left(n_{0}(\omega)+1\right) D(q, \omega) \approx T \int_{0}^{T} d \omega \int d \phi \frac{q}{\omega^{2}+\left(C q^{3}\right)^{2}}
\]</span></p>
<p>In the second step we replaced the Bose factor <span class="math inline">\(n_{0}(\omega)+1\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(T / \omega\)</span> and the integration limit by <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(T&gt;C \Delta_{q}^{3},\)</span> we can first perform the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> integration by extending the upper limit to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. The integrand is now <span class="math inline">\(1 / q^{2}\)</span>. We approximate <span class="math inline">\(q^{2} \approx \Delta_{q}^{2}+\left(k_{F} \phi\right)^{2},\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> integration gives a constant. This shows that the scattering rate is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(T / \Delta_{q} .\)</span> In the opposite case of <span class="math inline">\(T&lt;C \Delta_{q}^{3}\)</span> it is easy to see that the upper limit of the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> integral gives an additional factor of <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> leading to a <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> behavior. As mentioned earlier, unlike the electron-phonon problem, the scattering rate is never exponentially activated. A more accurate calculation shown later gives the same result. It is worth remarking than since umklapp scattering involves a final state that carries current in the opposite direction, there is no significant distinction between a transport lifetime which is sensitive to the momentum relaxation of each collision and the collision time, in contrast to the case of forward scattering. [11] On the other hand, since the scattering is concentrated at certain points on the Fermi surface, in order to calculate transport properties it is necessary to determine how the momentum distribution relaxes in the vicinity of these points. We need to solve the Boltzmann equation using the scattering processes as input. This is done in the following sections.</p>
<p>We will calculate the resisitivity, magneto-resisitivty, Hall conductivity and the Hall constant <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span>. The key physics is that the important scattering process is concentrated near the antinodal point. As such, there is a lot of overlap in the mathematical framework with a different problem involving scattering by antiferromagnetic fluctuations at momentum <span class="math inline">\((\pi, \pi)\)</span> where strong scattering are concentrated at hot spots. [9] This problem was thoroughly investigated by Rosch [10] and his work was very helpful to us. In particular he found a linear T resistivity and linear B magnetoresistivity in certain parameter range. Just as in his case, we found that while some impurity scattering is needed to restrict the modification of the distribution function to the vicinity of a special point on the Fermi surface, the coefficient of the linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> term is independent of disorder. In this paper we focus on the relatively low temperature regime where the impurity scattering rate is comparable to the inelastic scattering rate, ie. when the temperature dependent part of the resistivity is comparable to the zero temperature limit. We defer discussion of the high temperature limit, or the clean limit, to a later paper.</p>

<p>The reader may worry whether one can use a Boltzmann equation when there are no quasi-particles in the Landau sense. The answer is that the Boltzmann equation can be derived without assuming the existence of quasi-particles, as long as the self energy depends on <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> and not on momentum. ( In our problem the leading self energy correction depends only on <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>. While a small <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> dependence was discovered in a higher order expansion [13], we do not expect this to affect the argument in a significant way.) The above- mentioned result was shown in a classic paper by Prange and Kadanoff.[14] Their motivation was that in the electron-phonon scattering problem at temperature high compared with the Deybe temperature, the self-energy is <span class="math inline">\(\pi \lambda \omega\)</span> which can be larger than <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> and yet the Boltzmann equation was used routinely. We have adopted their method to the composite fermion problem [15] and here we sketch the main idea. The key observation by Prange and Kadanoff is that the electron spectral function takes the form <span class="math display">\[
A( k , \omega)=\frac{\Sigma^{\prime \prime}(\omega)}{\left(\omega-\epsilon_{ k }-\Sigma^{\prime}(\omega)\right)^{2}+\Sigma^{\prime \prime}(\omega)^{2}}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{\prime}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{\prime \prime}\)</span> are the real and imaginary part of the self energy. For <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{\prime \prime}(\omega) \sim \omega^{2 / 3}\)</span> the spectral function is indeed very broad as a function of <span class="math inline">\(\omega,\)</span> but at a given small <span class="math inline">\(\omega,\)</span> it is actually a sharp function of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{k}-\mu .\)</span> This distinction is a familiar one in the modern ARPES literature, where the energy dispersion curve (EDC) is broad and the momentum dispersion curve (MDC) is sharp. The conventional derivation of the Boltzmann equation starting from the nonequilibrium Green's function involves integrating over <span class="math inline">\(\omega .\)</span> What Prange and Kadanoff proposed to do is to pick a patch of the Fermi surface specified by <span class="math inline">\(k(\theta)\)</span> which defines a contour along the Fermi surface parametrized by the direction <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> of the Fermi momentum vector and integrate the perpendicular momentum and hence over <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{k}\)</span> instead. As a result, instead of the usual distribution function <span class="math inline">\(f( k )\)</span> they introduced the function <span class="math inline">\(f(k(\theta), \omega) .\)</span> Note that in the usual formulation, the vector <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is decomposed into <span class="math inline">\(k(\theta)\)</span> and the momentum in the perpendicular direction, which is then represented by <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{k}-\mu .\)</span> Thus we can simply write down the standard Boltzmann equation with the understanding that in the momentum <span class="math inline">\(k ,\)</span> the component perpendicular to the Fermi surface is replaced by <span class="math inline">\(\left(\epsilon_{k}-\mu\right) / v_{F}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left(\epsilon_{k}-\mu\right)\)</span> is in turn is replaced by <span class="math inline">\(\omega .\)</span> We next introduce in the standard way the linear perturbation from the equilibrium by writing <span class="math inline">\(f( k )=f_{0}\left(\epsilon_{ k }\right)-\left(d f_{0}\left(\epsilon_{ k }\right) / d \epsilon_{ k }\right) \tilde{\Phi}( k )=f_{ k }^{0}+f_{ k }^{0}\left(1-f_{ k }^{0}\right) \tilde{\Phi}( k ) / T\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f_{0}\left(\epsilon_{ k }\right)=f_{ k }^{0}\)</span> is the Fermi distribution and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( k )\)</span> has the interpretation of a local shift of the chemical potential at patch <span class="math inline">\(\theta .\)</span> This leads to the linearized Boltzmann equation [7]: <span class="math display">\[
\left(e v _{ k } \cdot E +e\left( v _{ k } \times B \right) \cdot \partial_{ k } \tilde{\Phi}\right) \frac{\partial f_{0}\left(\epsilon_{ k }\right)}{\partial \epsilon_{ k }}=-I_{e e}-I_{e i}
\]</span> where the electron-electron collision term is given by <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
I_{e e}=&amp; \sum_{ p , q , G } 2\left(g^{2} / T\right)\left|P\left( q , \epsilon_{ k }-\epsilon_{ k - q }\right)\right|^{2}[\tilde{\Phi}( k )+\tilde{\Phi}( p )-\tilde{\Phi}( k - q + G )-\tilde{\Phi}( p + q )] \\
&amp; f_{ k }^{0} f_{ p }^{0}\left(1-f_{ k - q + G }^{0}\right)\left(1-f_{ p + q }^{0}\right) \delta\left(\epsilon_{ k }+\epsilon_{ p }-\epsilon_{ k - q + G }-\epsilon_{ p + q }\right)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where G denotes a set of reciprocal lattice vectors and the electron-impurity collision term is <span class="math inline">\(I_{e i}=-\gamma_{0} \tilde{\Phi}( k )\left(d f_{0}\left(\epsilon_{ k }\right) / d \epsilon_{ k }\right)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{0}\)</span> is the impurity scattering rate. Note that we have described the scattering process as a electron-electron scattering via the exchange of the boson propagator <span class="math inline">\(D(q, \omega),\)</span> rather than the scattering between electrons via the emission and absorption of bosons. The reason is that the conservation of total momentum for the normal scattering <span class="math inline">\(( G =0)\)</span> is clearly seen in Eq. <span class="math inline">\(5 .\)</span> The distribution will rapidly equilibrate to a Fermi function with a shifted overall momentum <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( k ) \propto k . E\)</span> so that its contribution to the collision integral is exactly zero. Had we considered the emission and absorption of bosons, we would have to keep track of the shifted boson distribution function as well, which introduces more complications. Next, we will show that the vanishing of the normal collision term is more general. As long as the scattering is predominantly forward, then in order to conserve momentum and energy, the scattering partner <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> must be approximately equal to either <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(- k\)</span>. In the first case the last two terms in [] in Eq 5 cancel the first two terms to first order in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. In the second case, since <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}(- k )=-\tilde{\Phi}( k ),\)</span> the first two terms in [] in Eq 5 approximately cancel. A similarly argument applies for the next two terms corresponding to the outgoing pair <span class="math inline">\(p + q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k - q .\)</span> In the presence of impurity scattering which ensures that <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( k )\)</span> is smoothly varying, these arguments show that the contribution from normal scattering to the collision integral is negligible. This argument works also in the presence of a magnetic field. The Fermi surface is shifted along an axis that is rotate from the direction of the applied field <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> but the relation <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}(- k )=-\tilde{\Phi}( k )\)</span> continues to hold. So from this point on we will keep only the umklapp term <span class="math inline">\(( G \neq 0)\)</span> in Eq. <span class="math inline">\(5 .\)</span> On the other hand, in the clean limit, it is necessary to keep the normal scattering because the small residual terms left over from the approximate cancellation control the local equilibration and slow diffusion of the the disturbance of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( k )\)</span> along the Fermi surface towards the umklapp points. This is beyond the treatment of the current paper and is the reason why the results of this paper are limited to relatively low temperatures.</p>
<p>Our next step is to integrate out <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and the radial part of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> taking advantage of the fact that <span class="math inline">\(d f_{0}(\omega) / d \omega\)</span> ) is a sharply peaked function. To be concrete we choose the origin in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> space so that it is completely enclosed by the Fermi surface and we parametrize the Fermi surface by the angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> as shown in Fig <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> Leaving details to the Appendix, we find <span class="math display">\[
e v _{F}(\theta) \cdot E +e\left( v _{F}(\theta) \times B \right) \cdot \frac{\partial \Phi(\theta)}{k_{F} \partial \theta}=\int \frac{d \theta^{\prime}}{2 \pi} 2 g^{2} \nu\left(\theta^{\prime}\right) F\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right)\left(\Phi(\theta)-\Phi\left(\theta^{\prime}\right)\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\nu(\theta)=k_{F} /\left(2 \pi v_{F}\right)\)</span> is the density of states factor at angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta .\)</span> In this equation, all variables are defined on the Fermi surface as parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)\)</span> is defined as <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}(k(\theta), \omega=0) .\)</span> The kernel of the integral equation <span class="math inline">\(F\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right)\)</span> depends on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{\prime}\)</span> only via the magnitude of the momentum transfer <span class="math inline">\(q\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right)\)</span> which connects the points <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{\prime}\)</span> on the umklapp Fermi surface as shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> Here we focus on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> near zero, and the discussion should be repeated for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> close to the other three nearest neighbor umklapp Fermi surfaces. The kernel is given by <span class="math display">\[
F\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right)=\int n_{0}(\omega)\left(n_{0}(\omega)+1\right)(\omega / T) D(q, \omega) d \omega
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n_{0}(\omega)\)</span> is the Bose function. Note that after integration out the scattering partner, the Boltzmann equation now takes the form of umklapp scattering by emission and absorption of the mode defined by <span class="math inline">\(D(q, \omega)\)</span>. The kernel can be written in the form <span class="math inline">\(F\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right)=2 q f(a)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a=C q^{3} / T\)</span> and the scaling function <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[

[9] For our numerical work we find it useful to approximate <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> by the form suggested by Rosch [10] which matches the large and small <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> limits and is accurate to <span class="math inline">\(2 \%\)</span> everywhere: <span class="math inline">\(f(a)=\pi^{2}(2 \pi+a) /\left[a\left(4 \pi^{2}+6 \pi a+3 a^{2}\right)\right]\)</span> The coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)\)</span> on the right hand side of Eq. 6 can be interpreted as the scattering out rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(\theta)\)</span> for an electron at <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[
\gamma(\theta)=\int 2 g^{2} \nu\left(\theta^{\prime}\right) F\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right) d \theta^{\prime} / 2 \pi

Then <span class="math inline">\(q\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right)\)</span> can be approximated by <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{q_{0}^{2}(\theta)+\left(k_{F} \phi\right)^{2}}\)</span> The <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{\prime}\)</span> integral can be replaced by an integral over <span class="math inline">\(\phi .\)</span> For <span class="math inline">\(T \ll C q_{0}^{3}(\theta),\)</span> we use the form for large a given after Eq. 8 .

<h3 id="方程的解">3 方程的解</h3>
<p>The difficulty of the solution of the Boltzmann equation comes from the second term in Eq 6 which involves an integral over <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\left(\theta^{\prime}\right) .\)</span> To make analytic progress, we shall argue that a relaxation time approximation is justified for the resistivity <span class="math inline">\((B=0)\)</span> at low temperatures, which we verify later with a numerically exact solution. Let us consider an electric field <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> along <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B=0 .\)</span> We expect the Fermi surface to be displaced along <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the displacement will satisfy <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta+\pi)=-\Phi(\theta) .\)</span> From Fig <span class="math inline">\(1,\)</span> we expect <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{\prime}\)</span> to be near <span class="math inline">\(\pi .\)</span> So we define <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{\prime \prime}=\theta^{\prime}-\pi .\)</span> Furthermore, since <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is peaked near small <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> we expect <span class="math inline">\(-\theta^{\prime \prime}\)</span> to be near <span class="math inline">\(\theta .\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is an even function of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in the absence of <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> and we expect it to be slowly varying on the scale of the relatively short range kernel <span class="math inline">\(F\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right),\)</span> we can replace <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\left(\theta^{\prime}\right)\)</span> on the right hand side in Eq 6 by <span class="math inline">\(-\Phi(\theta) .\)</span> This leads to the relaxation time approximation, with a relaxation time of <span class="math inline">\(1 /(2 \gamma)\)</span>. We obtain <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)=e v _{ F } \cdot E /\left(2 \gamma(\theta)+\gamma_{0}\right)\)</span> and the current and conductivity can be computed by averaging the product of <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)\)</span> and the x component of the Fermi velocity over the Fermi surface in the standard way. For simplicity we will assume a circular Fermi surface with a constant Fermi velocity in the analytic estimate below.</p>
<p>In the absence of impurity scattering, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)\)</span> is strongly suppressed near the umklapp point where the scattering is strong. The current is mainly carried by nodal electrons and current is no longer controlled by the distribution function near the umklapp points. A similar situation was pointed out by Hlubina et al [9] in connection with the hot-spot problem. Just as in that case, [10] the situation is different once a small amount of impurity scattering is introduced, with scattering rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{0} \ll 1\)</span>. The conductivity (resistivity) saturates to a constant <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{0}\left(\rho_{0}\right)\)</span> at zero temperature and we can consider the relative deviation at finite <span class="math inline">\(T .\)</span> For small deviation <span class="math inline">\(\left(\rho(T)-\rho_{0}\right) / \rho_{0}=-\left(\sigma(T)-\sigma_{0}\right) / \sigma_{0}=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(-\gamma_{0} \int\left(1 /\left(2 \gamma(\theta)+\gamma_{0}\right)-1 / \gamma_{0}\right) d \theta / 2 \pi\)</span> We will use Eq. 10. For <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q} \ll k_{F}, q_{0}(\theta)\)</span> can be approximated by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q}+2 k_{F} \theta^{2} .\)</span> The integral over <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is easily done after extending the integration limits to infinity, a step which is justified as long as <span class="math inline">\(\left(\rho(T)-\rho_{0}\right) / \rho_{0}&lt;1 .\)</span> We obtain <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\rho(T)-\rho_{0}}{\rho_{0}}=\frac{\alpha T /\left(\gamma_{0} \sqrt{2 k_{F}}\right)}{\sqrt{\Delta_{q}+2 \alpha T / \gamma_{0}}}
\]</span> This equation should be valid for <span class="math inline">\(T&gt;C \Delta_{q}^{3}\)</span> and when the value of <span class="math inline">\(\left(\rho(T)-\rho_{0}\right) / \rho_{0}\)</span> is limited to be less than unity. We conclude that the resistivity begins as a constant <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{0}\)</span> plus a <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> term which quickly changes to a linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> dependence, and then crosses over to a limited region of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{T}\)</span> behavior for <span class="math inline">\(T&gt;\Delta_{q} \gamma_{0} / \alpha\)</span> before the limit set by <span class="math inline">\(\left(\rho(T)-\rho_{0}\right) / \rho_{0}&lt;1\)</span> is reached. Note that the coefficient of the linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> term in the resistivity <span class="math inline">\(\rho(T)\)</span> itself is independent of the impurity scattering rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{0}\)</span> and is therefore intrinsic. It depends weakly on <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(1 / \sqrt{\Delta_{q}}\)</span>. At even higher temperatures, the assumption of the conductivity being dominated by small <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> no longer holds and the resistivity increases faster than linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>We next solve the Boltzmann equation numerically without making the relaxation time approximation. This is done by discretizing the <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{\prime}\)</span> variable in Eq. 6 and converting the integral-differential equation (in the presence of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> ) by a matrix equation. Inverting the matrix numerically gives an accurate solution for <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta) .\)</span> The results for the resistivity are shown in Fig <span class="math inline">\(2 .\)</span> We introduce the dimensionless umklapp vector measured in units of the Brillouin zone size <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=\Delta_{q} / 2 \pi .\)</span> We also re-write <span class="math inline">\(C \Delta_{q}^{3}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{C}\left(\Delta_{q} / k_{F 0}\right)^{3}\)</span> and in the numerical calculations we set <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{C}=C k_{F 0}^{3}=1\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k_{F 0}\)</span> is the Fermi wavevector along <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0 .\)</span> We also set <span class="math inline">\(g=1\)</span> which simply sets the scale of the temperature dependent part of the conductivity. For the band dispersion <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }\)</span> we use the parametrization suggested by Horio et al. [16] for <span class="math inline">\(Nd\)</span> doped <span class="math inline">\(LSCO , t^{\prime} / t=-0.136, t^{\prime \prime} / t=0.068\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t^{\prime}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t^{\prime \prime}\)</span> are the further neighbor hopping integrals. This model has a van Hove singularity at doping <span class="math inline">\(p \approx 0.22\)</span> beyond which the large hole Fermi surface centered at <span class="math inline">\((\pi, \pi)\)</span> becomes an electron Fermi surface centered at zero. Near this doping the dimensionless umklapp vector <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is very small. In Fig. 2 we see that the relaxation time approximation works very well at low temperature, but lies above the exact results and deviates from linearity sooner as temperature increases. The linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> behavior is very clear at low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> from the inset of Fig 2 a. For <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=0.066\)</span> the initial <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> term is hardly visible, but becomes apparent for the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=0.105\)</span> case, as expected from the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{3}\)</span> dependence of the crossover scale. We verify that the resistivity slope is independent of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{0}\)</span> by inspecting Fig <span class="math inline">\(2 .\)</span> The cross-over to <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{T}\)</span> is rather subtle and can be seen as a region of convex curvature in the inset of Fig. 2a. Numerically the linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> like regime extends to about <span class="math inline">\(2 \rho_{0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In Fig 3 a we show <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)\)</span> for a range of temperatures for a finite impurity concentration. At zero temperature, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)\)</span> is given by the relaxation time approximation due to impurity scattering alone and the dips at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> are due to the smaller Fermi velocity there. In the inset, we see that at low temperature, the <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is further suppressed mainly near the umklapp points at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> so that the current is reduced in a way that is linear in T. As the temperature further increases. the current is increasingly being carried by fermions away from the umklapp points. This is responsible for the eventual deviation from linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in the resistivity. We also show Fig <span class="math inline">\(3 b\)</span> the distribution function <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{0}(\theta)\)</span> in the relaxation time approximation. We see that the relaxation time approximation works very well at low temperature, but tends to over-estimate the effect of temperature as <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> increases, leading to the upward curvature for the resistivity shown by the red lines in Fig.2.</p>

<p>We next discuss the effect of an orbital magnetic field, and compute the Hall effect and magnetoresistance. Our model contains a number of features which have been seen experimentally in a number of Cuprates. Here we show some useful comparisons and also point out a number of inadequacies of our model.</p>
<p>The Hall coefficient <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> is calculated from the linear <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> coefficient in the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation and shown by the blue lines in fig. <span class="math inline">\(4 .\)</span> For comparison we also show the relaxation time approximation result, using the standard Zener-Jones formula. [17] <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{x y}=\frac{2 e^{3} B}{h} \int \frac{d \theta}{2 \pi} \frac{v_{y}}{\gamma(\theta)} \frac{d\left(v_{x} / \gamma(\theta)\right)}{d \theta}
\]</span> The two results agree exactly at zero temperature where impurity scattering dominates, but to our surprise they deviate strongly at higher temperatures. The zero temperature value is a bit lower than the expected <span class="math inline">\(1 /(1+p) .\)</span> This is because we assume a constant scattering rate as appropriate for Born scattering. If we assume a constant mean-free path as is appropriate for impurities with a fixed scattering cross-section, we do find <span class="math inline">\(1 /(1+p) .\)</span> This difference is as expected in the presence of anisotropic Fermi velocities. [17] At finite temperatures our model has inelastic scattering rate which strongly depends on the position on the Fermi surface, being large near the umklapp point. At a given <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> its temperature changes from linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> moves away from the umklapp point, as seen from Eq. <span class="math inline">\(10 .\)</span> This kind of anisotropic scattering has been used as phenomenological models with considerable success to fit the conductivity and the angle dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR) for the Tl based and other cuprates. [18, 19] They assume an isotropic Fermi liquid like <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> term and a non-Fermi liquid <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> term that is concentrated near the anti-node. This kind of model bears a lot of similarity to the relaxation time approximation of our more microscopic model. Therefor the resistivity results are similar. Their calculated Hall coefficient also shows a weak temperature dependence, consistent with the red curves in Fig.4. However, we see that the relaxation time approximation fares poorly for the Hall coefficient, which we find to decrease strongly with increasing temperature. As we can see by comparing Fig. 4 a and b, the decrease is faster and the discrepancy is stronger for smaller <span class="math inline">\(\Delta .\)</span> This result suggests the following physical picture. Consider an electron near <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\pm \pi / 2\)</span> in the presence of an <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> field along <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The umklapp process scatters the electron to a final state on the Fermi surface in the neighboring Brillouin zone in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> direction. This is equivalent to near perfect back scattering and the final state has a y component of the Fermi velocity that is opposite in sign to that from a near forward scattering process. This can lead to a reduction and eventually a sign change in the Hall effect as the temperature increases. The information about the final state is encoded in the <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\left(\theta^{\prime}\right)\)</span> term on the right hand side of Eq. 6 but is absent in the relaxation time approximation. To confirm this picture we have calculated <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> in a model where the umklapp scattering to the neighboring Fermi surfaces located in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> direction have been removed, leaving only two umklapp points along the electric field direction. As seen from Fig. 5 the Hall coefficient is now increasing with <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and is qualitatively similar to the relaxation time approximation result.</p>
<p>Experimentally <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> that decreases with increasing temperatures was observed in underdoped and optimally doped YBCO in the early days of high <span class="math inline">\(T_{c}\)</span> research and considered to be a major puzzle. [20,21] It has never been explained by any theory based on the relaxation time approximation and inspired exotic suggestions such as two different lifetimes for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y} \cdot[22]\)</span> The fact that a strongly temperature dependent <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> shows up due to the breakdown of the relaxation time approximation may give a hint to this long standing puzzle. We should caution that in the experiment <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> is well fitted to a <span class="math inline">\(1 / T\)</span> form while our results in Fig. 4 is closer to a linearly decreasing function. Furthermore, this behavior is seen most strongly in the underdoped Cuprates, where <span class="math inline">\(1 / R_{H} \approx p\)</span>. This is a feature of the pseudogap which is not captured in our present model, which gives in the limit of low temperature <span class="math inline">\(1 / R_{H} \approx 1+p\)</span>.</p>
<p>We also computed the Hall conductivity <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y}\)</span> and the magneto-resistivity <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{x x}\)</span> as shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(6 .\)</span> The magneto-resistivity is initially quadratic in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as expected, by switches over to a linear dependence. However, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y}\)</span> also deviates from linear <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> at a similar <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> scale. This indicates a breakdown of the weak field condition <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{c} \tau&lt;1\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hbar \omega_{c}=e B / m\)</span>. In a tight binding model we can roughly set <span class="math inline">\(m \approx 1 / 2 t\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(B \approx \hbar \omega_{c} / 2 t\)</span> which gives us a sense of the size of the dimensionless parameter <span class="math inline">\(B .\)</span> For an accessible field of tens of Tesla's, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is indeed of order <span class="math inline">\(10^{-2}\)</span> as shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(4 .\)</span> It has been pointed out that a linear <span class="math inline">\(|B|\)</span> magneto-resistance can happen when a group of carriers is moved by the magnetic field to round a corner at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\pm \pi / 2,\)</span> where the x component of the Fermi velocity changes sign. This can be a striking effect when the curvature of the turning point is large.[23] A linear magneto-resistance is also found in a parameter range associated with linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> resistivity by Rosch <span class="math inline">\([10] .\)</span> However, it is not known whether <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y}\)</span> also deviates from linearity in these cases. Experimentally linear <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> magneto-resistance have been found to be associated with the low temperature linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> behavior in both the Cuprates [3,24] and the iron based superconductors <span class="math inline">\([25] .\)</span> It is often (but not always [24] ) fitted to the form <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{B^{2}+T^{2}}\)</span>. However, this is observed in the <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{c} \tau&lt;1\)</span> regime and it is not clear if our theory applies. Recent experiments even indicate that the linear in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> magneto-resistance may have a Zeeman rather than orbital origin. [3] The effect of a magnetic field on the distribution <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is shown in fig. <span class="math inline">\(7 .\)</span> We can see the distribution being shifted to the right, but its magnitude also becomes asymmetric as the field is increased. Note that the condition that <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is an odd function of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is violated by the magnetic field, and the argument given earlier in support of the relaxation time approximation fails.</p>
<h3 id="结论">5 结论</h3>
<p>We have treated a model of fermions scattered by a critical bosonic mode with umklapp scattering being the dominant momentum relaxation mechanism. After introducing a weak impurity scattering, we find that above a very low temperature scale, the resistivity is linear in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. We find that the resistivity is charaterized by a highly anisotropic scattering rate, which is linear in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> near the umklapp points and becoming <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> as we move away from the umklapp point. It should be noted this is happening in a model where inverse life-time of the fermion is large, proportional to <span class="math inline">\(T^{2 / 3}\)</span> and Landau's criterion for Fermi liquid is violated. Thus the lifetime of the electron as measured by ARPES is totally different from that inferred from transport measurements. We also find a serious breakdown of the relaxation time approximation in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a Hall coefficient <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> that decreases with increasing temperature. This is a unique feature (or signature) of transport that is dominated by umklapp scattering. While many of these features have be seen in Cuprates, we should caution that our model has made a specific assumption that the boson mode is completely soft, i.e. we are either at the quantum critical point or in a critical phase. Deviation from critically will give a low temperature cut-off of the phenomena we describe. We should also remember that the model assumes a sharp fermi surface in the sense that the electron spectral function is sharp in momentum space at low energy, i. e. the MDC as seen in ARPES is well defined. Thus our model does not have the pseudogap at the antinode, which is a dominant feature in underdoped Cupartes. Recently it was shown that the MDC becomes sharp abruptly for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> greater than a certain <span class="math inline">\(p_{c}[26]\)</span> and our model may be better suited for this doping range.</p>

<p>We sketch the derivation of Eq. 6 starting from Eqs. 4 and <span class="math inline">\(5 .\)</span> The idea is to integrate out the variable <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and replace it with the fermion susceptibility. In the case of umklapp scattering, we expect <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to be far from the umklapp points, so that <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( p )\)</span> is slowly varying and we can drop the term <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( p )-\tilde{\Phi}( p + q )\)</span> on the right hand side for small <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.

\]</span> The appearance of the Bose factor on the right signals that we are describing a particle-hole excitation which has Bose statistics. Next we do the integration along the Fermi surface which we can replace by <span class="math inline">\(k_{F} d \theta_{p}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{p}\)</span> specifies a patch on the Fermi surface. For small <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> we can write <span class="math inline">\(\delta\left(\omega+\epsilon_{ p }-\epsilon_{ p + q }\right)=\delta\left(v_{ p } \cdot q -\omega\right) .\)</span> We choose the origin of <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{p}\)</span> to be the point where <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is tangent to the Fermi surface. The delta function then becomes <span class="math inline">\(\delta\left(v_{F} q \sin \left(\theta_{p}\right)-\omega\right) .\)</span> Doing the <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{p}\)</span> integration gives the factor <span class="math inline">\(\omega / v_{F} q\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\omega&lt;v_{F} q,\)</span> as expected for Landau damping. We obtain <span class="math display">\[
I_{e e}=\left(g^{2} / \pi T\right) \sum_{ q } \delta\left(\epsilon_{ k }-\epsilon_{ k - q + G }-\omega\right)\left(n_{0}(\omega)+1\right) f_{ k }^{0}\left(1-f_{ k - q + G }^{0}\right)\left(k_{F} \omega / v_{F} q\right)|D(q, \omega)|^{2}[\tilde{\Phi}( k )-\tilde{\Phi}( k - q + G )]
\]</span> Finally we integrate Eq. 4 over <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }\)</span> The lefts side gives the left side of Eq <span class="math inline">\(6 .\)</span> On the right side the fermi factors force <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }-\mu\)</span> to be small and we can replace <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( k )\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)\)</span> as defined in the text. The integration over <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }\)</span> is done by using Eq. 13 again, and we obtain Eq. 6 .</p>
