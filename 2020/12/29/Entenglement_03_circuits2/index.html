<h2 id="摘要">摘要</h2>
<p>Starting from a state of low quantum entanglement, local unitary time evolution increases the entanglement of a quantum many-body system. In contrast, local projective measurements disentangle degrees of freedom and decrease entanglement. We study the interplay of these competing tendencies by considering time evolution combining both unitary and projective dynamics.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We begin by constructing a toy model of <strong>Bell pair dynamics</strong> which demonstrates that measurements can keep a system in a state of low <span class="math inline">\((i . e .\)</span> area law <span class="math inline">\()\)</span> entanglement, in contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary time evolution.</li>
<li>While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement for any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show that <strong>more generic models</strong> of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law transition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with recent numerical investigations.</li>
<li>As a concrete example of these ideas, we analytically investigate <strong>Clifford evolution</strong> in qubit systems which can exhibit an entanglement transition. We are able to identify stabilizer size distributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed points.'</li>
<li>We also discuss <strong>Floquet random circuits</strong>, where the answers depend on the order of limits - one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any non-zero measurement rate, whereas a different order of limits allows for an area law - volume law transition.</li>
<li>Finally, we provide a rigorous argument that a system subjected to projective measurements can only exhibit a volume law entanglement entropy if it also features a subleading correction term, which provides a universal signature of projective dynamics in the high-entanglement phase.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="背景">背景</h2>
<p>The notion of quantum entanglement is a unifying theme across numerous areas of modern physics,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>from the study of solid state systems</li>
<li>to the study of black holes.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a condensed matter context, entanglement</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>not only provides a window into the study of quantum ground states,</li>
<li>but also is an important tool in characterizing the approach to thermal equilibrium (or the lack thereof).</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, the entanglement entropy of a ground state or a many-body localized state usually obeys an area law <span class="math display">\[
S \sim \ell^{d-1},
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> is the linear size of the partition.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, the entanglement entropy of a generic thermalizing state at a non-zero temperature is given by a volume law <span class="math display">\[
S \sim \ell^{d}
\]</span> While such static entanglement signatures are useful, there is also a great deal of <strong>information contained</strong> in the dynamics of entanglement. Consider preparing a system in a tensor product state, for example by performing a quantum quench.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the system exhibits <strong>many-body localization</strong>, then the growth of entanglement will be logarithmic in time, <span class="math inline">\(S \sim \log t .\)</span></li>
<li>In contrast, a <strong>generic thermalizing</strong> system will feature an initially ballistic <strong>(i.e. linear) entanglement growth</strong>, eventually approaching a <strong>volume law</strong>, as expected for a thermal system.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="unitary-projective-竞争">unitary projective 竞争</h4>
<p>(各种unitary演化情况下纠缠的演化：有没有守恒量，周期性驱动等等)Recently, studies have taken place on the growth of quantum entanglement under <strong>generic unitary</strong> time evolution, demonstrating in detail the linear growth of mean entanglement entropy, as well as determining the form of fluctuations around the mean. <span class="math inline">\(^{1}\)</span> Subsequent analyses have studied both entanglement growth and spreading of local operators under random unitary time evolution, both with and without conservation laws. <span class="math inline">\(^{2-7}\)</span> Similar work has also been done in the context of Floquet and Hamiltonian time evolution. <span class="math inline">\(^{8-16}\)</span></p>
<p>(unitary演化的反面，projective测量可以降低纠缠)But while unitary dynamics generically leads to the growth of entanglement, there is another more drastic type of time evolution which can decrease the entanglement of a quantum system. Under certain conditions, such as interaction with a macroscopic classical object, a quantum mechanical system can rapidly <strong>evolve into an eigenstate</strong> of a specific operator, such that the resulting time evolution appears to be a non-unitary projection. Such a process is referred to as a <strong>projective measurement</strong>. When the system is projected into an eigenstate of a local operator, the corresponding local degree of freedom is disentangled from the rest of the system, resulting in a decrease in overall entanglement. In this way, projective measurements can remove some of the entanglement created by more generic unitary time evolution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FIG.1 Unitary-projective time evolution can be modeled via a quantum circuit consisting of alternating layers of unitary and projective operators acting on a set of local degrees of freedom. The grey rectangles represent local unitary operators which generate entanglement between adjacent degrees of freedom, while the purple squares represent local projective measurements which remove entanglement from the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(一个增加entanglement，一个减小entanglement，很自然去问两者的竞争，这个动力学竞争的过程可能发生在大脑)since unitary time evolution and projective measurements have opposite effects on entanglement, <strong>it is natural to ask</strong> how a physical system behaves when both types of evolution play a prominent role. For example, a system could be subjected to a continuous series of measurements, as can be accomplished with superconducting qubits. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{17-19}\)</span> As another <strong>potential physical realization</strong>, it has been proposed by M. Fisher that Posner molecules may play a role in quantum information processing <strong>in the brain</strong>. <span class="math inline">\(^{20-22}\)</span> As these molecules bind and unbind, they undergo joint unitary-projective dynamics, generating entanglement between different molecules.</p>
<p>(测量对entanglement entropy的下降到底起到多少作用？只是降低增长速度，还是只要有测量就可以限制到面积定律)In such a system with joint unitary-projective evolution, it is not obvious how the presence of projective measurements modifies the behavior of a purely unitary system. It seems clear that measurement should decrease the steady-state entanglement entropy of the system. But by <strong>how much</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>A prior <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, one possibility is that measurements might simply <strong>decrease the coefficient</strong> of the resulting volume law entanglement entropy.</li>
<li>In contrast, recent numerical investigations have indicated that a <strong>sufficient</strong> amount of measurements can <strong>limit</strong> entanglement entropy to area law scaling, behavior which is normally associated with ground states or many-body localized eigenstates.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, simulations of free fermion systems subject to continuous monitoring has indicated that an <strong>arbitrarily low rate</strong> of measurement is sufficient to keep the system in a state of low entanglement. ${ }^{23} $ A hydrodynamic explanation for this behavior was also advanced.</p>
<p>(不同测量概率 <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> 下纠缠熵的增减行为，分析出存在相变点)More recently, multiple groups have investigated more generic unitary-projective time evolution, implemented in the language of quantum circuits. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{30-32}\)</span> Specifically, one can consider time evolution via a circuit consisting of alternating layers of unitary and projective operators, as depicted in Figure <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> If every site were measured during each projective step, then the system would be continually reset to a tensor product state and no entanglement would ever be built up. The more interesting scenario is when the local measurements are sparse. Consider projective evolution in which each site has probability <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to be measured at each time step. Equivalently, a randomly distributed fraction <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> of the sites are measured at every step.</p>
<ul>
<li>As <span class="math inline">\(f \rightarrow 1,\)</span> with every site being constantly measured, it is clear that the effects of projection dominate those of the unitary time evolution, and <strong>no significant entanglement</strong> should build up.</li>
<li>But for <span class="math inline">\(f \ll 1\)</span>, there are far more unitary than projective operators in the circuit, indicating that the unitary evolution should proceed largely unaffected by projection, driving the system towards volume law entanglement entropy.</li>
<li>Consistent with this expectation, <strong>two independent groups</strong> have confirmed that such a model exhibits a <strong>transition</strong> from a high-entanglement volume-law phase at low <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to a low entanglement area-law phase at <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> close to <span class="math inline">\(1 .^{30-32}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="文章结构">文章结构</h4>
<p>In this work, we analytically investigate several models in which the effects of measurements on entanglement can be explicitly studied.</p>
<h4 id="toy-models">1. toy models</h4>
<p>（用一个很简单的模型，简单到可以得到精确解，又足够抓住增减纠缠的两个主要角色。结果显示：长程贝尔配对被摧毁，系统主要是短程贝尔配对，这就是系统保持面积定律的原因）We begin in Section II by constructing <strong>toy models</strong> for entanglement dynamics under unitary-projective evolution.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We first consider a simple model of Bell pair dynamics which illustrates <strong>how measurements can limit</strong> entanglement entropy to area law scaling.</li>
<li>The model is simple enough to allow an <strong>exact calculation</strong> of the dynamics of entanglement entropy.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, it <strong>captures</strong> a crucial piece of physics which determines the interplay between the two types of dynamics: local unitary evolution primarily creates short range entanglement, while projective measurements can destroy entanglement on any length scale.</li>
<li>The <strong>result</strong> is that the system is dominated by <strong>small Bell pairs</strong>, leading to an area law for entanglement entropy. By continually <strong>removing long-range</strong> entanglement from the system, projective measurements are able to keep the entire system in a state of unusually low entanglement.</li>
<li>We also investigate the dynamics of entanglement, finding an overshoot phenomenon, whereby at intermediate times entanglement entropy exceeds its steady state value.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="稳定子">2 稳定子</h4>
<p>(这个相变可以被一个叫stabilizer generators稳定子的量描述，推导了稳定子的微分方程，可以预测相变)With these toy models in hand, we move on to test our intuition in more concrete situations with <strong>analytically tractable dynamics</strong>. First, in Section III, we consider Clifford evolution in a qubit system, in which the unitary layers of the dynamics have random operators drawn only from the set of <strong>Clifford gates.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>While this is <strong>not a universal</strong> set of gates, Clifford evolution allows for a <strong>convenient description</strong> of entanglement spreading in terms of an effective hydrodynamics.</li>
<li>We show that random Clifford evolution <strong>exhibits</strong> an area-to-volume law <strong>transition</strong> at a finite critical measurement rate.</li>
<li>This transition can be <strong>characterized</strong> in terms of the size of <strong>stabilizer generators</strong>, which are relatively small for high measurement rates, then jump to the size of the system at low measurement rates.</li>
<li>We derive a <strong>differential equation governing</strong> the stabilizer size distribution. This differential equation <strong>predicts</strong> the existence of both area and volume-law phases, as well as a critical point with a logarithmic area-law violation.</li>
<li>We also propose a hydrodynamic description for entanglement growth within the area-law phase.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="分隔界">3 分隔界</h4>
<p>这部分研究另一个模型</p>
<ul>
<li>熵在一些情况下可以映射到统计力学问题</li>
<li>交界越长，平均纠缠熵越高</li>
<li>任何比例的测量都会导致面积定律</li>
</ul>
<p>In Section IV, we investigate another type of analytically tractable model in the form of two Floquet random circuits with large on-site Hilbert space dimension.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In these circuits, the Renyi- <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> entropies for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \geq 2\)</span> can be <strong>mapped to emergent statistical mechanics</strong> problems, which amount to enumerating minimal-length domain wall diagrams.</li>
<li>The longer the lengths of the <strong>domain walls</strong> in these diagrams are, <strong>the higher</strong> the averaged entanglement entropy of these circuits will be.</li>
<li>In the regime at infinite <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and finite but arbitrarily large <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, an area-law saturation of higher Renyi entropies results from the fact that projective measurements can provide effectively <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> "free" segments of domain walls, along which no amount of entanglement entropy is associated. This indicates an area-law phase for <strong>any finite measurement rate</strong>, consistent with the Bell pair model. However, the <strong>conclusions are sensitive to</strong> the order of limits, and a different order of limits may allow for an area-to-volume law transition at a finite critical measurement rate.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="一般性讨论">4 一般性讨论</h4>
<p>In Section <span class="math inline">\(V ,\)</span> we present certain <strong>general arguments</strong> constraining the form of entanglement entropy in the presence of measurements.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We find that, while an area law entanglement entropy can exist without any special extra structure, a volume law entanglement entropy can <strong>only exist</strong> in the presence of a subleading correction.</p></li>
<li><p>While the results in this section are all for Von Neumann entropy, Renyi entropies <span class="math inline">\(S_{n}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;1\)</span> are all upper bounded by Von Neumann entropy, so these results serve as useful upper bounds on all higher Renyi entropies.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, in Section VI, we summarize our results and outline certain future directions of investigation opened by our work.</p>
<p>Note: A previous version of this manuscript made the erroneous claim that area-law entanglement entropy was generically present for any nonzero measurement rate. This is true in some models (which constitute a particular universality class) but is not true for all models. This mistake has been corrected in the more detailed analysis of the present version, the results of which supersede all previous versions.</p></li>

<p>介绍Bell Pair Model是什么样子</p>
<ul>
<li>最多两个比特纠缠</li>
<li>或者这个比特和系统都没有联系</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to build intuition for unitary-projective dynamics, it is useful to construct a toy model which captures some of the important physical features. To this end, we first focus on a particularly simple form of entanglement. We consider states which can be fully described in terms of Bell pairs,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>maximally entangled two qubit states, such as a spin singlet. In other words, we study a system of qubits in which each qubit is either maximally entangled with another qubit</li>
<li>or is completely disentangled from the system (see Figure 2).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210105203354546.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>FIG.2 We study a qubit system in which each qubit either forms a maximally entangled Bell pair with another qubit (represented by an oval) or is completely disentangled from the rest of the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For such a system, we can <strong>easily obtain</strong> the entanglement entropy by <strong>counting</strong> the number of Bell pairs which are cut by a given partition. While such Bell pair configurations are a restricted class of states, this model will <strong>provide important intuition</strong> as to how measurements can restrict entanglement entropy to area law scaling. All Renyi entropies are equal for this model.</p>
<p>(对增长纠缠的操作做详细规定)To build unitary-projective dynamics into the toy model, we must consider the effects of both types of operators on Bell pairs.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We first consider applying a layer of local unitary operators, as in Figure 1. Such a <strong>layer of operators</strong> will result in entanglement between neighboring qubits which were previously disentangled from the rest of the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistent with the <strong>restrictions</strong> of our toy model, we take this entanglement to be <strong>maximal</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In other words, local unitary operators can generate Bell pairs between previously unentangled neighboring qubits.</p></li>
<li><p>When a unitary operator acts on a qubit which was already in a Bell pair, it can move one end of the Bell pair to an adjacent site, which may cause the Bell pair to <strong>grow or shrink</strong> in size.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Bell pairs can move through one another. Starting from a state with mostly small Bell pairs ( <span class="math inline">\(i . e .\)</span> a state of low entanglement), generic local unitary time evolution will cause Bell pairs to increase in size, leading to the growth of entanglement for generic spatial partitions.</p>
<p>(对减少纠缠的操作做详细规定)While local unitary operations tend to increase entanglement, via creating small Bell pairs which subsequently grow in size, the projective portion of the time evolution has a radically different effect. Performing a projective measurement on a qubit has the effect of disentangling it from the rest of the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>If that qubit happened to be in a Bell pair with another qubit, that Bell pair is destroyed by the measurement. Notably, this mechanism for Bell pair destruction is equally effective for Bell pairs of any size, since a local measurement on either qubit is sufficient to destroy a Bell pair, <strong>regardless of the distance</strong> to the other qubit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The model thereby captures the expected interplay between unitary and projective dynamics:</p>
<ul>
<li>creation of <strong>short-range</strong> entanglement (and its subsequent growth) by unitary operators,</li>
<li>coupled with removal of entanglement at all length scales by projective measurements.</li>
</ul>
<p>（产生短程纠缠，移除任意路程的纠缠，如此往复，系统将只剩下短程纠缠）</p>
<h4 id="分布函数的方程">分布函数的方程</h4>
<p>Combining these two types of physical processes, we can now very easily write down a set of equations governing the time evolution of the distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> on the spatial size <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of Bell pairs. At each time step, the local unitaries cause a given Bell pair to</p>
<ul>
<li>either grow (with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_{g}\)</span> ),</li>
<li>shrink (with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_{s}\)</span> ),</li>
<li>or remain the same size (with probability <span class="math inline">\(\left.\left(1-p_{g}-p_{s}\right)\right) .\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We also take a fraction <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;\tilde{f}&lt;1\)</span> of the Bell pairs to be destroyed, i.e. be reset to zero size, where <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}=2 f-f^{2}\)</span> is the probability of the Bell pair being measured on at least one of its two sites. Away from <span class="math inline">\(x=0,\)</span> the time evolution equation for <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> takes the form:</p>

<li>However, the second term on the right, arising from the projective measurements, causes the distribution to decay, preventing entanglement from propagating very far from <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>.</li>

</ul>
<p>We see that the steady state solution of the joint unitary-projective time evolution is <strong>dominated</strong> by small Bell pairs, such that the system is mostly <strong>short-range entangled</strong>. This makes intuitive sense, in that long-range entanglement is being constantly removed from the system by projective measurements, while the entanglement resulting from local unitary evolution is only being created on short scales. We can directly calculate the typical entanglement entropy of the system. For example, consider a one-dimensional system, which we partition into two half-lines. A qubit at a distance <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from the cut will contribute one bit (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\ln 2\)</span> ) to the entanglement entropy if it is a member of a Bell pair of size at least <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and if that Bell pair extends in the direction of the cut. Summing contributions from all qubits on one side of the partition, we obtain: <span class="math display">\[
S \sim \int_{0}^{\infty} d x \int_{x}^{\infty} d x^{\prime} P\left(x^{\prime}\right) \sim \text { constant }
\]</span> The entanglement entropy is a constant, i.e. <strong>independent</strong> of the system size <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, since the exponentially decaying distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> yields a convergent integral. Since the entanglement entropy is constant, we conclude that the asymptotic state of the unitary-projective evolution obeys an <strong>area law</strong>, as opposed to the <span class="math inline">\(S \sim L\)</span> behavior of a volume law state. In higher dimensions, we will have the same sort of exponential convergence of the entropy integrals, except with a factor of area arising from integrating over the entire partition. In this way, our Bell pair toy model gives rise to an area law for entanglement entropy in any dimension.</p>
<h4 id="含时间的解">含时间的解</h4>
<p>In addition to the steady state, it is also easy to obtain the full time evolution of the Bell pair distribution. The generic solution to Equation <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{x} P=-\frac{\tilde{f}}{\gamma(1-\tilde{f})} P\)</span> takes the form: <span class="math display">\[

</ul>
<p>The resulting time evolution takes the form of waves which <strong>propagate</strong> at velocity <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, while decaying via the exponential factor <span class="math inline">\(e^{-\lambda x} .\)</span> For example, let us consider an initial tensor product state, such that all the weight of <span class="math inline">\(P(x, t=0)\)</span> is concentrated at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> and the entanglement entropy is zero. As time evolves, the peak at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> propagates to the right at speed <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, just as in the case of pure unitary evolution. For short times <span class="math inline">\((t \ll 1 / \lambda v),\)</span> the entanglement entropy will therefore grow <strong>linearly</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(S \sim v_{E} t,\)</span> with an <strong>effective entanglement velocity</strong> given by: <span class="math display">\[
v_{E}=\gamma(1-\tilde{f})
\]</span> We see that the initial entanglement velocity of this unitary-projective system is smaller than that of a pure unitary system by a factor of <span class="math inline">\((1-\tilde{f}) .\)</span> As time evolves, however, the slowdown of entanglement growth becomes more severe, as the weight in the propagating peak decays exponentially and is transferred back to the origin, as depicted in Figure 3 .</p>

<h3 id="b.-cluster-model">B. Cluster Model</h3>
<p>In the previous subsection, we encountered a toy model for entanglement dynamics under unitary projective time evolution which featured area-law entanglement entropy for any nonzero measurement rate.</p>
<p>在任意低的测量速率下，面积定律的持续存在可能是贝尔对玩具模型的限制性所造成的。</p>
<p>所以我们发展了一个更普遍的模型，这个模型会有非零测量率下的“面积-体积”相变</p>
<p>However, the persistence of the area-law down to arbitrarily low measurement rates may be an artifact of the restricted nature of the Bell pair toy model, which captures only a limited set of entanglement patterns. In this subsection, we generalize the previous model to account for slightly more general types of entanglement. Specifically, we allow for larger clusters of <strong>mutually entangled spins</strong>, instead of the simple two-body entanglement of the Bell pair model. We find that this generalized model features an area-to-volume law <strong>transition</strong> at a <strong>nonzero critical measurement rate</strong>. Thus, while the Bell pair model provides a good description of the novel area-law phase, it is not sufficiently powerful to describe the details of the area-to-volume law phase transition.</p>
<h4 id="定义新模型">定义新模型</h4>
<p>对新模型的规则进行定义，和之前的主要差别在于：</p>
<ul>
<li>之前一个spin只跟一个spin纠缠</li>
<li>现在可以和多个spin纠缠</li>
</ul>
<p>多个spin可以定义cluster，假如A和B纠缠，A和C纠缠，那么我们认为，B和C也纠缠。他们属于同一个cluster</p>
<p>To construct a more general model of entanglement than the simple Bell pair model, we allow each spin to be entangled with <strong>any number</strong> of other spins, as opposed to being entangled with only a single other spin.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>However, starting from a <strong>product state</strong>, entanglement will still be built up locally.</li>
<li>At short times, a given spin will only be significantly entangled with some local cluster of spins.</li>
<li>We work in one dimension for simplicity, labeling the <strong>size of a cluster</strong> of entangled spins as <span class="math inline">\(x .\)</span>
<ul>
<li>Note that a Bell pair of size <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is one special example of a cluster of size <span class="math inline">\(x,\)</span> in which only the two end spins are entangled.</li>
<li>More generally, however, all spins within a given cluster will be <strong>entangled with each other</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As in the Bell pair model, we can describe the system by a <strong>probability distribution</strong> of the size of clusters, <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>因为之前只能两个纠缠，所以测量之下就降为0. 现在的clusters在测量之下可以降到一个非零值。</p>
<p>As with Bell pairs, local unitary evolution will tend to increase typical size of clusters, which grow in a local fashion, spreading ballistically. Also, as before, measurements will tend to decrease the size of clusters.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, whereas measurement on a Bell pair automatically decreases its size from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to 0 ,</li>
<li>measurement on a terminal spin of an entangled cluster can drop the size of the cluster to anywhere between 0 and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. (Note that measurement on the interior of the cluster cannot decrease its size.)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="分布函数的方程-1">分布函数的方程</h4>
<p>原来微分方程中加了一项修正项，这个项对纠缠的影响是上面呢？</p>
<p>稳态条件给出了一个临界值 <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}_{c}\)</span>：</p>
<ul>
<li>当 <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}&gt;\tilde{f}_{c},\)</span> 只有实数解，系统是短程纠缠，对应面积定律</li>
<li>当 <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}&lt;\tilde{f}_{c},\)</span> 没有稳态解，纠缠增长</li>
</ul>
<p>For a measurement on a terminal spin to drop the size of a cluster from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x^{\prime}\)</span>, all spins between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^{\prime}\)</span> must be disentangled from the rest of the cluster. The probability of having all spins between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^{\prime}\)</span> disentangled from the rest of the cluster decays rapidly, as an <strong>exponential</strong> function of <span class="math inline">\(x-x^{\prime} .\)</span> As such, we can very simply <strong>modify</strong> the differential equation governing <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> as follows: <span class="math display">\[
\partial_{t} P=-(1-\tilde{f}) \gamma \partial_{x} P-\tilde{f} P+\tilde{f} \int_{x}^{\infty} d x^{\prime} P\left(x^{\prime}\right) e^{-\mu\left(x^{\prime}-x\right)}
\]</span> for some parameter <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, where the final term represents the growth of <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> due to clusters of size <span class="math inline">\(x^{\prime}\)</span> dropping to size <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></p>
<p>With this new toy differential equation in hand, we consider its <strong>implications</strong> for entanglement. Let us first assume, as before, that the steady state distribution is exponentially decaying, <span class="math inline">\(P(x) \sim e^{-\lambda x}\)</span>. Plugging in this ansatz, Equation <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{x} P=-\frac{\tilde{f}}{\gamma(1-\tilde{f})} P\)</span> implies that we must have: <span class="math display">\[
\lambda(1-\tilde{f}) \gamma-\tilde{f}+\frac{\tilde{f}}{\lambda+\mu}=0
\]</span> 1. As <span class="math inline">\(\mu \rightarrow \infty,\)</span> this <strong>reduces to</strong> the results of the previously studied Bell pair model, with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=\tilde{f} / \gamma(1-\tilde{f}),\)</span> which is real and positive for any value of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\)</span>. 2. However, as <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> decreases, this equation will eventually cease to have <strong>real solutions</strong>.</p>
<p>Through straightforward algebra, it can be checked that there are only real solutions for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> when the measurement rate satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}&gt;\tilde{f}_{c},\)</span> where the critical measurement rate is: <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{f}_{c}=\frac{\gamma \mu^{2}}{2-2 \sqrt{1-\mu}-\mu+\gamma \mu^{2}}
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}&gt;\tilde{f}_{c},\)</span> we will therefore have only short-range entanglement, resulting in an area law for entanglement entropy.</li>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}&lt;\tilde{f}_{c},\)</span> however, an exponential cannot be a steady state solution, but rather will feature a growing entanglement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, it is easy to show that no power-law decay can provide a steady state solution when <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}&gt;\tilde{f}_{c}\)</span>. In this regime, therefore, <span class="math inline">\(P(x)\)</span> will run off towards being close to uniform, thereby resulting in a maximally entangled volume law state.</p>
<p class="note note-primary">
This toy model thus demonstrates that area law behavior need not persist down to arbitrarily low measurement rates, as in the Bell pair model. More generically, a system may exhibit an area-to-volume law transition at a finite critical measurement rate.

<p>While the toy models in the previous section are useful for building <strong>intuition</strong>, it is important to have more concrete models with <strong>analytically tractable</strong> dynamics in which we can observe the same physics. We now <strong>test our intuition</strong> in a model of a one-dimensional system evolving via an almost-random set of unitary gates. Specifically, we consider the unitary operators of the time evolution to be randomly drawn from the set of <strong>Clifford gates</strong>, a form of dynamics referred to as Clifford evolution.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>While this is not a universal set of gates, Clifford evolution in one dimension provides certain convenient <strong>technical simplifications</strong> while still capturing most of the qualitative features of truly random unitary evolution.</li>
<li>It also has the virtue that all Renyi entropies behave the same way.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="稳定子-1">稳定子</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clifford evolution relies on a simple action of Clifford gates on states labeled in terms of <strong>stabilizers</strong>, i.e. operators <span class="math inline">\(O_{i}\)</span> which leave the state invariant, such that <span class="math inline">\(O_{i}|\psi\rangle \sim|\psi\rangle .\)</span></li>
<li>For a one-dimensional system with <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> sites, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> such stabilizers will be necessary to fully label the state. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> is a tensor product state, then all <span class="math inline">\(O_{i}\)</span> will be local operators, acting non-identically only on a single site. 这种稳定剂将是必要的，以充分标明状态。</li>
<li>For an entangled state, the stabilizer operators extend over multiple sites, with the size of stabilizers <strong>increasing</strong> as the state becomes more entangled. 越纠缠，稳定子会增长</li>
<li>The value of Clifford evolution lies in its simple action on Pauli operators, mapping each Pauli to a product of other Pauli operators.

<li>Typically, these stabilizers are <strong>uniformly</strong> spread out in the system, and the number of stabilizers of weight <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> intersecting site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the density of stabilizers of weight <span class="math inline">\(w,\)</span> multiplied by the weight <span class="math inline">\(w,\)</span> i.e. <span class="math inline">\(n_{w} w / L=P_{w} w .\)</span></li>

<p>The effects of measurement in the context of Clifford evolution can also be understood using a representation in terms of a set of fictitious "particles," as developed in Reference 1 , which also allows a slightly more refined analysis. We briefly recap the central idea behind the particle representation of Clifford evolution, referring the reader to Reference 1 for further details.</p>
<h4 id="对应的粒子图像">对应的粒子图像</h4>
<p>For many purposes, it is <strong>sufficient</strong> to only keep track of the endpoints of the stabilizer, which encode information about the length of the Pauli strings. To this level of detail, we can represent a state by a set of <strong>fictitious "particles"</strong> representing the stabilizer endpoints, as depicted in Figure <span class="math inline">\(5,\)</span></p>

<li>The system contains as many particles as sites, and no more than <strong>two particles</strong> can occupy any site.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li>blue circles represent right endpoints</li>
<li>and white circles represent left endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be shown that, due to a gauge freedom in choosing the stabilizers labeling the state, the total number of endpoints (left plus right) on a site can be chosen to be exactly two. It is then sufficient to only keep track of the right endpoints (blue circles), while the left endpoints can be regarded simply as "<strong>holes</strong>." Within this representation, a tensor product state corresponds to a uniform density of particles, since each site is the left and right endpoint of a local (on-site) stabilizer. <strong>Entanglement is then represented as a deviation from this uniform density</strong> (纠缠被表示为对这个均匀密度的偏离). Indeed, as discussed in Reference <span class="math inline">\(1,\)</span> the entanglement entropy associated with a partition at location <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is given by: <span class="math display">\[
S(x)=\sum_{i&gt;x}\left(\rho_{i}-1\right)
\]</span> In other words, the entanglement entropy is given by the excess particle number on one side of the partition. As the system evolves under random unitary time evolution, the tendency is for stabilizers to grow, which amounts to particles (i.e. right endpoints of stabilizers) to drift to the right.</p>
<h4 id="粒子的扩散方程">粒子的扩散方程</h4>
<p>As shown in Reference 1 , unitary evolution causes the particles to undergo biased diffusion, such that the density evolves as: <span class="math display">\[
\partial_{t} \rho=\nu \partial_{x}^{2} \rho+\frac{\Lambda}{2} \partial_{x}\left((\rho-1)^{2}\right)-\partial_{x} \eta
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> are constants</li>
<li>and <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> is a random variable representing noise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>pure unitary evolution would take the system to a maximally entangled state, in which all particles are as far to the right as possible, as seen in Figure 5 .</li>
<li>However, this flow of particles to the right is interrupted in the presence of projective dynamics.</li>

<li>加入新项方程变成非线性方程</li>
</ul>
<p>The effect of local measurements is to disentangle spins from the rest of the system, which corresponds to the <strong>destruction of stabilizers</strong> (i.e. resetting them to length 1). We can easily account for the removal of nontrivial stabilizers in the diffusion equation by adding a decay term on deviations from the mean density: <span class="math display">\[
\partial_{t} \rho^{\prime}=\nu \partial_{x}^{2} \rho^{\prime}+\Lambda \rho^{\prime} \partial_{x} \rho^{\prime}-\tilde{\lambda}_{\rho} \rho^{\prime}-\partial_{x} \eta
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{\prime}=\rho-1 .\)</span></p>
<p>Based upon the discussion from the previous subsection, the decay constant <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\lambda}_{\rho}\)</span> should depend on the quasiparticle distribution <span class="math inline">\(\rho,\)</span> which in turn is set by the stabilizer distribution. However, let us focus our attention for now to the area-law phase, for which we assume that the stabilizer distribution is short-ranged, such that the exponential factor in Equation 11 <span class="math inline">\(Problowest(w)=\frac{1}{2^{\sum_{w^{\prime}=1}^{w} P_{w}^{\prime} w^{\prime}}}\)</span> is negligible. Then we can safely take <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\lambda}_{\rho} \sim f\)</span> to be a constant.</p>
<p>The differential equation for <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{\prime}\)</span> now takes the form of a non-linear diffusion equation, where the diffusing density can decay with constant probability. It is exponentially unlikely that significant density will diffuse very far to the right of the cut, as expected for the area law phase.</p>
<h4 id="纠缠熵的空间分布方程">纠缠熵的空间分布方程</h4>
<p>为此</p>
<p>We now propose a hydrodynamic description for entanglement under unitary-projective dynamics within the low-entanglement area-law phase. We begin with the observation from Reference 1 that under random unitary time evolution, the entropy on a given site <span class="math inline">\(S(x)\)</span> evolves according to <span class="math display">\[
\partial_{t} S=D \partial_{x}^{2} S+1-\left(\partial_{x} S\right)^{2}+\eta
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> is a noise term. We now wish to also account for the effects of projective measurements. When a site is measured, it becomes disentangled with the rest of the system, such that there is no difference in entanglement between the partitions to the immediate left and right of that site. In other words, measurement sets the value of <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{x} S\)</span> to zero on that site. The projective portion of the evolution then acts as a decay term on the evolution of <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{x} S,\)</span> which does not have a natural local form in terms of <span class="math inline">\(S .\)</span> We therefore take a derivative of Equation 23 and add an appropriate decay term to yield: <span class="math display">\[
\partial_{t} S^{\prime}=D \partial_{x}^{2} S^{\prime}-2 S^{\prime} \partial_{x} S^{\prime}-f S^{\prime}+\partial_{x} \eta
\]</span> where we have defined <span class="math inline">\(S^{\prime}=\partial_{x} S .\)</span> We see that <span class="math inline">\(S^{\prime}\)</span> obeys the same diffusion equation as the particle density in the case of Clifford evolution (see Equation 22 ), which also served as the derivative of entropy.</p>
<p>We conjecture that this hydrodynamic equation should be <strong>valid</strong> not just for Clifford-projective dynamics, but for the area-law phase of <strong>all models</strong> of unitary-projective dynamics in this universality class.</p>
<h2 id="周期性随机线路">周期性随机线路</h2>
<p>We now <strong>move</strong> from Clifford circuits to a fully random circuit model, similar to Ref. 8 and 9.</p>

<p>Specifically, we consider two 1-dimensional <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> -site Floquet (timeperiodic) unitary circuits generated by Haar-distributed random unitaries, where the quantum states at each site span a <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -dimensional Hilbert space.

<p>Our <strong>set-up</strong> for the unitary-projective time evolution is as follows.</p>
<ol type="1">

<li>A <strong>non-unitary measurement</strong> layer is applied after every <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> layers of the unitary circuit.</li>
<li>Each time we apply a measurement layer, we randomly draw <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> fraction of sites to perform projective measurements.</li>

</ol>
<p>Remarkably, the diagrammatic approach provides a <strong>mapping</strong> from ensemble averages of observables to emergent <strong>classical statistical mechanics problems.</strong></p>
<h4 id="极限">极限</h4>
<p>When working with Floquet random circuits, it is important to be mindful of the order of limits, since there are three separate limits being taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>the thermodynamic limit <span class="math inline">\(L \rightarrow \infty,\)</span></li>
<li>the long time limit <span class="math inline">\(t \rightarrow \infty,\)</span></li>
<li>the limit of large onsite Hilbert space dimension <span class="math inline">\(q \rightarrow \infty\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The appropriate order of limits depends of course on the problem we are trying to solve - and the physics is highly sensitive to the order of limits.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For example, when the <span class="math inline">\(L \rightarrow \infty\)</span> limit is taken before the <span class="math inline">\(t \rightarrow \infty\)</span> limit, then one obtains the analysis of <span class="math inline">\(31 .\)</span> In this order of limits, the authors of 31 obtain (at least for Renyi-0 entropy) a phase <strong>transition</strong> between a low measurement volume law phase and a high measurement area law phase.</li>
<li>In contrast, the analysis we present is in the opposite order of limits, when <span class="math inline">\(t \rightarrow \infty\)</span> before <span class="math inline">\(L \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. We show that if the limit <span class="math inline">\(q \rightarrow \infty\)</span> is also taken before <span class="math inline">\(L \rightarrow \infty\)</span> then there is an area law saturation of entanglement entropy for any non-vanishing fraction <span class="math inline">\(f,\)</span> and no volume law phase.</li>
<li>In contrast, if the limit <span class="math inline">\(L \rightarrow \infty\)</span> is taken before the limit of large <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> then we can only argue for area law saturation at sufficiently large <span class="math inline">\(f,\)</span> and cannot exclude the possibility of an area-volume law transition at a critical <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</li>

</ul>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we will assume <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=2\)</span> for the following derivations, but the proofs can be straightforwardly extended to general Renyi index <span class="math inline">\(\alpha .\)</span> Now, we investigate the behaviour of entanglement entropy growth with unitary-projective time evolution at a time smaller than the saturation time. It is instructive to consider the effect of performing a single projection operator <span class="math inline">\(P (c, i)=\sqrt{q}|c, i\rangle\langle c, i|\)</span> onto color state <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> at site <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and time <span class="math inline">\(t_{ P }\)</span>. In App. A, we prove that the relevant diagrams are the minimal-length DW diagrams whose DW passes through the space-time point <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_{ P }\)</span> (Fig. 7 left), because this segment of DW does not give rise to a factor of <span class="math inline">\(q^{-1}\)</span> (i.e. this DW segment is "free"), which makes this diagram more dominant in the <span class="math inline">\(1 / q\)</span> -perturbative series. The algebraic factor associated to such diagrams is <span class="math inline">\(q^{-t+1}\)</span>. Generally, for a finite period <span class="math inline">\(p,\)</span> fraction <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> smaller than <span class="math inline">\(t_{\text {sat }}\)</span> (to be specified below), the leading diagrams of <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle q^{-S_{2}(t)}\right\rangle\)</span> contain DW that passes through the location of a projection measurement every <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> unitary layers, and the order is <span class="math inline">\(q^{-t+t / / p}\)</span> (Fig. 7 right), where <span class="math inline">\(/ /\)</span> is the floor division. An expression for the multiplicity of such leading order DW diagrams can be written in terms of a transfer matrix (acting on a Hilbert space labelled by the DW position) as described in App. B.</p>
<p>At a time sufficiently large, the minimal-length DW diagrams are the ones with DW ending on the side of the diagrams. Without measurements, there are two leading diagrams where the DW-s are solely directed to the left or the right (Fig 6 right). With measurements, minimal-length DW diagrams are the ones with DW passing through a certain number of projection operators to reach the side of the diagrams. We prove in App. A the following equation. <span class="math display">\[
\lim _{q \rightarrow \infty}\left\langle q^{(1-\alpha) S_{\alpha}(t)}\right\rangle=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
\beta q^{(1-\alpha)(t-t / / p)} &amp; t \leq p s \\
\left.\gamma q^{(1-\alpha)[(p-1)(s-1)+t}(\bmod p)\right] &amp; t&gt;p s
\end{array}\right.
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s=\operatorname{ceil}(1 / 2 f),\)</span> ceil <span class="math inline">\((\cdot)\)</span> is the ceiling function, and where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> are independent of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and dependent of L. On the LHS, we have implicitly averaged over the positions of projection operators in a given measurement layer.</p>
<p>The intuition behind the result is can be explained using Fig. 8. At large <span class="math inline">\(t,\)</span> the leading "staircase" diagrams are the ones with the DW reaching the side of the diagrams in the shortest distance, utilizing the "free" segments of walls provided by the projective measurements (purple segments in Fig. 8). The area-law saturation originates from the fact that the DW in these leading staircase diagrams pass through <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> free DW segments. Take <span class="math inline">\(f=1 / 4\)</span> as an example, there exists a realization of projection measurements such that the DW can reach the side using 2 measurement layers each of which provides <span class="math inline">\(L / 4\)</span> "free" DW segments (Fig. 8 right). So the orders of such diagrams are at least <span class="math inline">\(q^{-2(p-1)}\)</span>. In general, it takes ceil <span class="math inline">\((1 / 2 f)\)</span> number of "stairs" (and hence periods) to reach either side of the diagram. This explains Eq. 26</p>
<p>The combinatoric factor arising from requiring a staircase configuration of projection measurement locations implies that the coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is suppressed in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(f^{L},\)</span> but independent in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> (to be discussed further in Sec. IV C). Taking <span class="math inline">\(\log _{q}\)</span> on both side of Eq. <span class="math inline">\(26,\)</span> and taking the limit <span class="math inline">\(q \rightarrow \infty\)</span> for fixed but arbitrarily large <span class="math inline">\(L,\)</span> we have for large <span class="math inline">\(t&gt;p s\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
\lim _{q \rightarrow \infty} S_{\alpha} \leq(p-1) \operatorname{ceil}\left(\frac{1}{2 f}\right)
\]</span> which means that the Renyi- <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> entropy for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \geq 2\)</span> saturates according to the area law for finite <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and nonvanishing <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in the limit <span class="math inline">\(q \rightarrow \infty\)</span> at any finite but arbitrarily large <span class="math inline">\(L .\)</span> This is one of the first analytical calculations that demonstrate an area law saturation of entanglement entropy in Floquet random quantum circuit under unitary-projective dynamics, which remarkably occurs even with an infinite local Hilbert space dimension.</p>
<p>Some questions naturally follow from this analysis. First, how does the result extend to finite <span class="math inline">\(q ?\)</span> And what happens when we take the limit of large <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> but after we take the thermodynamic limit <span class="math inline">\(L \rightarrow \infty\)</span> ? To address these questions, we provide a heuristic argument to show that there are exponential many staircases diagrams in Sec.

<h3 id="floquet-random-phase-circuit">Floquet Random Phase Circuit</h3>
<p>The domain wall picture extends beyond the Floquet Haar random unitary circuit. Here we describe the analogous result (proved in App. A 2) in the Floquet random phase circuit first introduced in Ref. 9 (Fig. 9). This model is similarly defined by a <span class="math inline">\(q^{L} \times q^{L}\)</span> Floquet operator <span class="math inline">\(W=W_{2} \cdot W_{1}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(W_{1}=U_{1} \otimes U_{2} \otimes \cdots \otimes U_{L}\)</span> is a tensor product of independent Haar random unitaries, and <span class="math inline">\(W_{2}\)</span> couples neighbouring sites using a diagonal 2 -gates with entries <span class="math display">\[
\left[W_{2}\right]_{a_{1}, \ldots, a_{L} ; a_{1}, \ldots, a_{L}}=\exp \left(i \sum_{n} \varphi_{a_{n}, a_{n+1}}\right)
\]</span> Each <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{a_{n}, a_{n+1}}\)</span> is a Gaussianly-distributed random phase with mean zero and variance <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. This circuit has two parameters: (i) <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> which allows us to obtain analytical results at <span class="math inline">\(q \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, and (ii) <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, which allows us to tune how strongly nearest-neighbouring sites couple.</p>
<p>If the unit time is defined after the application of <span class="math inline">\(W_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W_{2}\)</span>, then in the strong-coupling limit <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon \gg \log q,\)</span> both Eq. 25 and 26 apply, and hence we have again Eq. 27 .

For the sake of simplicity, we consider an alternative set-up where there is a probability <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> for each site in a measurement layer to be projectively measured. Again, we explain the derivation explicitly for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=2,\)</span> but the argument holds for general <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \geq 2 .\)</span> Lastly, the argument below is applicable to both the models in Sec. IV A and IV B.</p>
<p>The origin of area law saturation <span class="math inline">\(S_{2}\)</span> can be related to DW diagrams that fulfil two criteria: (i) These diagrams have DW starting from the top centre of the diagram and ending on the side of the diagrams (otherwise the order of the diagrams decrease in time for <span class="math inline">\(p&gt;1\)</span> ). (ii) These diagrams have DW passing through at least <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> projective measurements (otherwise the diagram would have an order that scales in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> ). The diagrams that satisfy these criteria are the staircase diagrams (e.g. Fig. 8 right). We call a staircase diagram with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> number of staircases a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -staircase diagrams. The <span class="math inline">\(1 / q\)</span> -perturbative series of <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle q^{-S_{2}(t)}\right\rangle\)</span> can be written in terms of the contribution of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -staircase diagrams (Fig. 10 top) as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
\left\langle q^{-S_{2}(t)}\right\rangle \sim f^{L} \sum_{k=1}^{L} c_{k}\left[q^{-(p-1)}\right]^{k}+\ldots \\
\sim \exp \left[L\left(\log f+q^{-(p-1)}\right)\right]\left[q^{-(p-1)}\right]+\ldots
\end{array}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c_{k}=\int_{0}^{L} d l_{1} \int_{0}^{l_{1}} d l_{2} \cdots \int_{0}^{l_{k-2}} d l_{k-1}=L^{k-1} /(k-1) !\)</span> is the multiplicity of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -staircase diagram. As an example, the multiplicity of a 2 -staircase diagram is of order <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> because while the first staircase (counting from the top) always begin in the top center of the digram, the second staircase can begin anywhere between the center and the far right of the diagram (Fig. 10 top middle). The dots denote all other contributions to <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle q^{-S_{2}(t)}\right\rangle .\)</span> For general <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \geq 2\)</span>, the above equation becomes <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle q^{(1-\alpha) S_{\alpha}(t)}\right\rangle\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\sim \exp \left[L\left(\log f+q^{(1-\alpha)(p-1)}\right)\right]\left[q^{(1-\alpha)(p-1)}\right]+\ldots\)</span> For this contribution to not be suppressed in <span class="math inline">\(L,\)</span> we must have the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> -dependent exponent to be greater than zero, <span class="math display">\[
f \gtrsim e^{-q^{(1-\alpha)(p-1)}}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f \gtrsim e^{-q^{(1-\alpha)(p-1)}}
\]</span> This contribution implies it is plausible that the area-law saturation of <span class="math inline">\(S_{\alpha}\)</span> survive at least for large enough <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Note that this argument is not completely rigorous, because we have not systematically looked at all sub-leading terms in the <span class="math inline">\(1 / q\)</span> -perturbative series of <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle q^{(1-\alpha) S_{\alpha}(t)}\right\rangle .\)</span> In particular, there can in principle be diagrams that are algebraically translated in negative terms which lead to cancellation with other positive terms (these are called "non-Gaussian" diagrams in Ref. 8). To summarise, we have found an exponential numbers of staircase diagrams and argued that it is plausible for an area-law saturation of <span class="math inline">\(S_{\alpha}\)</span> to survive at least for large enough <span class="math inline">\(f,\)</span> even when the limit <span class="math inline">\(L \rightarrow \infty\)</span> is taken before the limit of large <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="体积定律相的限制">体积定律相的限制</h2>
<p>In this section, we present general arguments which highly constrain the form of von Neumann entanglement entropy in systems time-evolving via local unitaries and projectors, assuming a local Hilbert space of finite dimension. We find that a volume law entanglement entropy is not stable in the presence of measurements unless there is a subleading correction, which should serve as an important signature of measurement physics within the volume law phase. Insofar as Von Neumann entropy upper bounds Renyi entropies of higher index (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(S_{2}\)</span> ), this argument also provides upper bounds on the scaling of higher Renyi entropies. Throughout this section, 'entropy' refers to Von Neumann entropy, unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p>We consider a situation where, in alternating time steps, either nearest-neighbor unitaries or projective measurements are applied to each site with probability The basic observation is that for any region <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> the rate of entropy increase is only proportional to the size of the boundary <span class="math inline">\(|\partial A|,\)</span> while the rate of entropy decrease on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> due to measurement can generically be proportional to the total entropy of <span class="math inline">\(A .\)</span> The only way for these rates to balance would be for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to satisfy an area law. In contrast, a stable volume law phase requires a state in which measurements are much less effective at removing entanglement. We show that this requirement implies the existence of a subleading term in the entanglement entropy.</p>
<h3 id="a.-constraining-strong-volume-laws">A. Constraining strong volume laws</h3>
<p>In this subsection, we exclude the possibility of volume law von Neumann entropy without a subleading correction. First, we show that any bipartite unitary acting on <span class="math inline">\(D \times D\)</span> dimensions can increase the entanglement entropy between the two parties by no more than <span class="math inline">\(2 \log D\)</span>. To see this, imagine such a unitary <span class="math inline">\(U: a b \rightarrow a^{\prime} b^{\prime}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(d_{a}=d_{a^{\prime}}=d_{b}=d_{b^{\prime}}=D\)</span> applied to a state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle_{A a B b}\)</span> where Alice holds systems <span class="math inline">\(A a\)</span> and Bob holds <span class="math inline">\(B b\)</span>. Then, the increase in entanglement achieved by applying <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(a b\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta S_{ uni }=&amp;=S\left(A a^{\prime}\right)_{\rho_{A a^{\prime}}^{f}}-S(A a)_{\rho_{A a^{\prime}}^{i}} \\
&amp;=S\left(a^{\prime} \mid A\right)_{\rho^{f}}-S(a \mid A)_{\rho^{i}} \\
&amp; \leq S\left(a^{\prime}\right)+S(a) \leq 2 \log D
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Here we have used the notation of conditional entropy <span class="math inline">\(S(A \mid B)=S(A B)-S(B) .\)</span> We have also used the subadditivity of entropy, <span class="math inline">\(S(A B) \leq S(A)+S(B),\)</span> and the Araki-Lieb inequality: <span class="math inline">\(S(A \mid B) \geq-S(A)\)</span> (Ref. 25<span class="math inline">\()\)</span>. This is actually a simplified derivation of a bound found in 26 , which studies the general problem of entanglement generation via bipartite unitaries.</p>
<p>Next, assuming <span class="math inline">\(A=A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\)</span> is composed of subsystems, we derive an upper bound on the entropy change caused by measuring a constant fraction <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> of those subsystems. Letting <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be the collection of subsystems that are not measured, and <span class="math inline">\(M_{T^{c}}\)</span> be the classical outcomes of the measurement on the complement, <span class="math inline">\(T^{c}\)</span>, we see that the average entanglement-entropy change by measurement is given by <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta S_{\text {meas }} &amp;=\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T} \mid M_{T_{c}}\right)-S\left(A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\right) \\
&amp; \leq \sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T}\right)-S\left(A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> We can use these two observations to conclude that small-scale volume-law-like scaling must saturate to an area law for sufficiently large sizes in any spatial dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. For the sake of contradiction, suppose our <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> consists of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> contiguous spins <span class="math inline">\(A_{1} \ldots A_{n},\)</span> and that the entropy of the system <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> scales as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
S\left(A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\right) &amp;=\gamma n+g(n) \\
&amp;=\gamma|A|+g(|A|),
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g(|A|)=o(|A|)\)</span> is a correction term. Our goal is to upper bound <span class="math display">\[
\Delta S_{\text {meas }} \leq-\gamma f|A|+o(|A|)
\]</span> To this end, we apply Eq. <span class="math inline">\(36,\)</span> but we must handle a slight subtlety. While Eq. 38 posits only the asymptotic behavior of entropies of contiguous sets of spins, the right-hand side of Eq. 36 involves entropies of noncontiguous spins. To see how this works, fix <span class="math inline">\(T_{c}\)</span> (the spins being measured) and label the contiguous systems between successive points in <span class="math inline">\(T_{c}, V_{1}, \ldots, V_{k} .\)</span> The typical size of <span class="math inline">\(V_{i}\)</span> will be <span class="math inline">\(\approx 1 / f\)</span> and there will be <span class="math inline">\(k \approx f n\)</span> such contiguous sets.</p>
<p>We give two arguments. In the first argument, we assume a stronger requirement on our correction term, demanding <span class="math inline">\(g(n)=o(1)\)</span>. Given this, fixing a particular <span class="math inline">\(V_{i},\)</span> letting <span class="math inline">\(A_{L}\)</span> denote a large number of spins to the left of <span class="math inline">\(V_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_{R}\)</span> a large number to the right, strong subadditivity of entropy implies that <span class="math display">\[
S\left(V_{i}\right) \leq S\left(A_{L} V_{i}\right)+S\left(V_{i} A_{R}\right)-S\left(A_{L} V_{i} A_{R}\right)
\]</span> Applying the assumed scaling, this becomes <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
S\left(V_{i}\right) &amp; \leq \gamma\left(\left|A_{L}\right|+\left|V_{i}\right|\right)+\gamma\left(\left|V_{i}\right|+\left|A_{R}\right|\right) \\
&amp;-\gamma\left(\left|A_{L}\right|+\left|V_{i}\right|+\left|A_{R}\right|\right)+o(1) \\
&amp; \rightarrow \gamma\left|V_{i}\right|
\end{aligned}
\]</span> As a result, we find that <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T}\right) &amp;=\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(V_{1} \ldots . V_{k}\right) \\
&amp; \leq \sum_{T} p_{T} \sum_{i} S\left(V_{i}\right) \\
&amp; \leq \sum_{T} p_{T} \gamma\left|V_{i}\right| \\
&amp;=(1-f) \gamma n .
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Substitution into Eq.36 then yields Eq. 40 as desired. In the second argument, we allow a more relaxed scaling, where we do not require that the correction term <span class="math inline">\(g(n) \sim o(1),\)</span> but only require that the deviations around area law are independent and random (with mean zero) for different sets and over different realizations of <span class="math inline">\(T .\)</span> In this case we find <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T}\right) &amp;=\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(V_{1} \ldots V_{k}\right) \\
&amp; \leq \sum_{T} p_{T} \sum_{i} S\left(V_{i}\right) \\
&amp;=\sum_{T} p_{T} \sum_{i}\left(\gamma\left|V_{i}\right|+g\left(V_{i}\right)\right) \\
&amp;=(1-f) \gamma n+\sum_{T} p_{T} \sum_{i}\left(g\left(V_{i}\right)\right) \\
&amp;=(1-f) \gamma n+O(\sqrt{n})
\end{aligned}
\]</span> In both cases, we find <span class="math display">\[
\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T}\right) \leq(1-f) \gamma n+O(\sqrt{n})
\]</span> so that the entropy change due to measurement satisfies <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta S_{\text {meas }} &amp;=\leq \sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T}\right)-S\left(A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\right) \\
&amp; \leq(1-f) \gamma n-\gamma n+o(n) \\
&amp;=-f \gamma n+o(n)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> The change in entanglement entropy caused by one round of local unitaries satisfies <span class="math display">\[
\Delta S_{ uni } \leq 2 l \log q \leq 2|\partial A| \log q
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> is the number of <span class="math inline">\(q \times q\)</span> unitaries that straddle the boundary between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, which is equal to the length of the boundary of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Combining this with the change in the entanglement entropy due to measurement gives us <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta S_{\text {tot }} &amp;=\Delta S_{\text {meas }}+\Delta S_{\text {uni }} \\
&amp; \leq-f \gamma|A|+2|\partial A| \log q+o(|A|) .
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Note that for sufficiently large <span class="math inline">\(n=|A|,\)</span> this becomes negative since <span class="math inline">\(|\partial A|\)</span> scales more slowly than <span class="math inline">\(|A| .\)</span> As a result, a stable entropy of form Eq. (38) cannot be achieved. In particular, if we hope for volume law scaling of the form <span class="math inline">\(S(A)=\gamma|A|,\)</span> we find positive entropy growth rate can only be sustained for <span class="math display">\[
2|A|^{\frac{d-1}{d}} \log q \geq \gamma f|A|
\]</span> which requires <span class="math display">\[
|A| \leq\left(\frac{2 \log q}{\gamma f}\right)^{d}
\]</span> Alternatively, volume law entanglement must break down around a saturation entropy <span class="math display">\[
S_{\max } \approx \gamma\left(\frac{2 \log q}{\gamma f}\right)^{d}
\]</span> We can also show that a strong volume-law behavior is impossible in <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> with a simpler argument. Given a set <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> the local-unitary steps will tend to increase the entanglement entropy of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, while the projective measurements will tend to decrease it. Our goal is to identify the size at which these competing forces balance out. To understand the rate of entropy reduction due to measurements, we make some assumptions about the structure of the state on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In particular, we consider a situation where the entanglement entropy of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is nearly maximal (the state is nearly maximally mixed) and see how large an <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is consistent with this. In a sense, we are asking how big can <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be and be consisent with a very strong notion of volume law. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(|A|\)</span> spins. Then, after one step of measurements, a fraction <span class="math inline">\(f|A|\)</span> spins will be measured, and the resulting entropy will be <span class="math inline">\((1-f)|A| \log q\)</span> which is an entropy change of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S_{\text {meas }}=-f|A| \log q\)</span>. When a layer of local unitaries is applied, only two of the unitaries will straddle the edges of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (one at each end). The unitary step will therefore increase the entanglement entropy of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S_{\text {uni }} \leq 4 \log q .\)</span> So, after one unitary step and one measurement step, the change in entanglement entropy is <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta S_{ tot } &amp;=\Delta S_{\text {meas }}+\Delta S_{ uni } \\
&amp; \leq 4 \log q-f|A| \log q .
\end{aligned}
\]</span> We therefore find <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S_{\text {tot }} \leq 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(4 \leq f|A|\)</span>. This suggests that for <span class="math inline">\(|A| \leq 4 / f,\)</span> unitary-projective dynamics will increase the entanglement entropy of <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> but that it will saturate around <span class="math inline">\(|A| \approx 4 / f\)</span>. This simple argument holds only for near-maximally mixed states on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="b.-logarithmic-corrections-and-phase-transitions">B. Logarithmic corrections and phase transitions</h3>
<p>Now we argue that our general argument does allow for logarithmic corrections to area laws, and also for phase transitions between area law phases with and without logarithmic corrections. The argument is simple: suppose the entropy scales as <span class="math display">\[
S\left(A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\right)=\gamma|\partial A| \log |n|
\]</span> An argument analogous to that presented in the previous subsection gives <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\Delta S_{\text {meas }} &amp; \leq \gamma|\partial A| \log (1-f) \\
\Delta S_{\text {tot }} &amp; \leq 2|\partial A| \log q-\gamma|\partial A| \log (1-f)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> For <span class="math inline">\(f&lt;f_{c}=1-q^{2 / \gamma}\)</span> the upper bound on <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S\)</span> is positive, such that entropy growth of the form Eq. 66 can be sustained indefinitely, leading to a <span class="math inline">\(\log L\)</span> correction to area law behavior. For <span class="math inline">\(f&gt;f_{c}, \Delta S_{t o t}&lt;0,\)</span> and the scaling Eq.66 cannot be sustained, allowing only for a true area law.</p>
<h2 id="结论">结论</h2>
<p>In this work, we have investigated the entanglement dynamics of a system featuring a combination of unitary and projective time evolution, which have competing effects on quantum entanglement. We have argued that the effects of projection can keep the system in a state of low entanglement, featuring an area law for entanglement entropy, in contrast with the volume-law entanglement entropy resulting from generic pure unitary time evolution. We have constructed several toy models which capture the important features of unitary-projective evolution, such as the growth of short-range entanglement due to unitary evolution and the removal of entanglement at any scale by projective measurements. In the simplest model, described in the language of Bell pairs, an area-law phase persists down to arbitrarily low measurement rates. We have also shown that, starting from a product state, entanglement can often overshoot its late-time value prior to saturating to the area law. We then constructed a generalized cluster model which features an area-to-volume law transition at a finite critical measurement rate. We have tested this intuition in various concrete yet analytically tractable realizations of unitary-projective evolution. Specifically, we have studied Clifford evolution in one dimensional qubit systems, and Floquet random circuits in one dimension. In all cases, we find a stable area law phases. In some models, the area law phase persists to arbitrarily weak but non-zero measurement rates, whereas in others it gives way at a critical measurement rate to a low measurement volume law phase. We have further demonstrated that in the low measurement volume law phase there must be a subleading correction to the volume law (i.e. a strong volume law is impossible at any non-zero measurement rate).</p>
<p>We thus conclude that projective measurements can generically restrict systems to area law entanglement, at least for a sufficiently high measurement rate. This implies - counter-intuitively - that measurement of a quantum system can inhibit thermalization through local unitary time evolution, and help keep the system in a low entanglement state. This seems to be rather good news both for Fisher's model of quantum cognition, and for efforts to store and manipulate quantum information more generally.</p>
<p>The results of this manuscript are now consistent with numerical work by Li, Chen, and Fisher <span class="math inline">\(^{30,32}\)</span>, and by Skinner, Ruhman, and Nahum <span class="math inline">\(^{31}\)</span>. In Li, Chen, and Fisher, numerical data on unitary-projective evolution in systems of size up to <span class="math inline">\(L=500\)</span> was reported, and a phase transition was observed between a high measurement phase in which entanglement entropy reached a volume law. Meanwhile, Skinner, Ruhman and Nahum reported numerics on system sizes up to <span class="math inline">\(L=24,\)</span> and observed an analogous area-to-volume law transition.</p>
<p>Our work paves the way for future investigations into unitary-projective dynamics. There is much that remains unknown about the new measurement-driven area-law phase, as well as the area-to-volume law transition. The transition appears to have an important relationship with certain statistical mechanics models, such as percolation <span class="math inline">\(^{31}\)</span>, though the extent to which all properties of the transition can be understood in this language remains unclear. Regarding the new measurementdriven area-law phase itself, to what extent can the system be understood as an athermal 'localized' phase? Also, since area-law entanglement entropy is more commonly associated with quantum ground states, can the measurement-driven phase host unusual sorts of quantum orders, such as seen in the context of localization protected order? <span class="math inline">\(^{33}\)</span> There are many interesting questions remaining to be answered in this exciting new field.</p>
