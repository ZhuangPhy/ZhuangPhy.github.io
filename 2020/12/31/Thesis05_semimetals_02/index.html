<h2 id="摘要">摘要</h2>
<p>Insulating states can be topologically nontrivial, a well-established notion that is exemplified by the quantum Hall effect and topological insulators. By contrast, topological metals have not been experimentally evidenced until recently. In systems with strong correlations, they have yet to be identified. Heavy fermion semimetals are a prototype of strongly correlated systems and, given their strong spin-orbit coupling, present a natural setting to make progress. Here we advance a Weyl-Kondo semimetal phase in a periodic Anderson model on a noncentrosymmetric lattice. The quasiparticles near the Weyl nodes develop out of the Kondo effect, as do the surface states that feature Fermi arcs. We determine the key signatures of this phase, which are realized in the heavy fermion semimetal <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3}\)</span>. Our findings provide the much-needed theoretical foundation for the experimental search of topological metals with strong correlations, and open up a new avenue for systematic studies of such quantum phases that naturally entangle multiple degrees of freedom.</p>
<h2 id="简介">1简介</h2>
<p>Strongly correlated electrons represent a vibrant field that continues to expand its horizon. In heavy fermion systems, strong correlations make their ground states highly tunable and give rise to a rich phase diagram that features antiferromagnetic order, Kondoscreened and other paramagnetic phases, and beyond-Landau quantum phase transitions <span class="math inline">\((1,2) .\)</span> In the simplest cases, these systems can be considered in terms of the local moments originating from the <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> -electrons that Kondo couple to the spins of the conduction electrons. The interaction generates the Kondo spin-singlet ground state; the ensuing entanglement with the conduction electrons converts the local moments into quasiparticles that can hybridize with the conduction electrons. This leads to a metal with a large, strongly renormalized effective carrier mass, which is the hallmark of the heavy fermion system classification. The resulting state could be a heavy fermion metal or a Kondo insulator depending on whether the chemical potential lies within or falls between the hybridized bands (3-5). Electronically intermediate between the two cases are heavy fermion semimetals ( <span class="math inline">\(6-13\)</span> ). Several of these have a broken inversion symmetry, including <span class="math inline">\(CeRu _{4} Sn _{6}(6,7)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3}(9)\)</span></p>
<p>Semimetal systems are being theoretically studied in the noninteracting limit with spin-orbit coupling, which plays an essential role in obtaining topological phases of electronic matter (14-17). The Weyl semimetal in three dimensions (3D) was recently evidenced experimentally <span class="math inline">\((18-20) .\)</span> It possesses bulk excitations in the form of chiral fermions, with massless relativistic dispersions near pairs of nodal points in the momentum space, as well as surface states in the form of Fermi arcs ( <span class="math inline">\(21-24\)</span> ). Because both the bulk and surface states are gapless, one can expect that the Weyl semimetals are particularly susceptible to the influence of electron correlations. Moreover, strong correlations in non-perturbative regimes typically mix different degrees of freedom in generating low-energy physics; thus, in any strongly correlated Weyl semimetal, the low-energy electronic excitations are expected to involve degrees of freedol moments, which may be harnessed for such purposes as information storage and retrieval.</p>
<p>In this paper, we report the discovery of a Weyl-Kondo semimetal (WKSM) phase in a concrete microscopic model on a <span class="math inline">\(3 D\)</span> noncentrosymmetric lattice. This model contains the strongly correlated <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> electrons and a band of conduction <span class="math inline">\(s p d\)</span> electrons, respectively. It is realistic in that it captures the inversion-symmetry breaking and spinorbital coupling in a tunable way. In the regime where the electronelectron repulsion is much larger than the width of the conductionelectron band, the interaction-induced renormalization factor can be very large. In addition, because the inversion-symmetry breaking term, spin-orbit coupling and other electronic couplings are renormalized in very different ways, it is a priori unclear whether any Weyl state can be realized in a robust way. Our work advances an affirmative answer in this well-defined microscopic model. Moreover, we demonstrate the key signatures of the WKSM phase, which turn out to be realized in several new heavy fermion compounds.</p>
<p>The Hamiltonian for the periodic Anderson model to be studied is <span class="math display">\[
H=H_{d}+H_{c d}+H_{c}
\]</span> For a proof-of-concept demonstration, we consider a cubic system in which the breaking of inversion symmetry can be readily incorporated. This is a diamond lattice, which comprises two interpenetrating face-centered cubic lattices <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> (Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1( a )) .\)</span></p>

<h3 id="重要说明">重要说明</h3>
<p>While electronic states with nontrivial topology have traditionally been known in insulators, they have been evidenced in metals during the past two years. Such Weyl semimetals show topological protection while conducting electricity both in the bulk and on the surface. An outstanding question is whether topological protection can happen in metals with strong correlations. Here, we report the first theoretical work on any strongly correlated lattice model to demonstrate the emergence of a Weyl-Kondo semimetal. We identify Weyl fermions in the bulk and Fermi arcs on the surface, both of which are associated with the many-body phenomenon called Kondo effect. We determine a key signature of this Weyl-Kondo semimetal, which is realized in a newly discovered heavy fermion compound.</p>

Representing <span class="math inline">\(d_{i \sigma}^{\dagger}=f_{i, \sigma}^{\dagger} b_{i}\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(f_{i \sigma}^{\dagger}\left(b_{i}\right)\)</span> are fermonic (bosonic) operators satisfying the constraint <span class="math inline">\(b_{i}^{\dagger} b_{i}+\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{\sigma} f_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} f_{i \sigma}=1 .\)</span> At the saddle point level, we replace <span class="math inline">\(b_{i}^{\dagger}, b_{i} \rightarrow r,\)</span> and introduce a Lagrange multiplier <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> to enforce the local constraint. Defining $<em>{ k }^{T} (d</em>{ k }, A d_{ k , B} d_{ k , A} d_{ k , B}) $ and $ <em>{ k }^{T} (c</em>{ k , A}. c_{ k , B} c_{ k , A} .d_{ k , B}),$ we can transform Hamiltonian $ H_{c}, H_{c d}.$ and <span class="math inline">\(H_{d}\)</span> into the pseudospin basis using <span class="math inline">\(\breve{\Xi}_{ k }=S_{\sigma}^{\dagger} \Xi_{ k }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\breve{\Psi}_{ k }=S_{\sigma}^{\dagger} \Psi_{ k },\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(S_{\sigma}^{\dagger}=U_{\sigma} \tau_{0}\)</span> being a unitary matrix which consists of the <span class="math inline">\(|\pm D\rangle\)</span> eigenvectors. The effective hybridization becomes <span class="math inline">\(r V\)</span>, which is nonzero only for <span class="math inline">\(V&gt;V_{c}\)</span>, whenever the conduction-electron density of states has a pseudogap form near the Fermi energy (2). The hybridization part can be re-expressed as <span class="math display">\[
H_{c d}=\sum_{ k }\left[\breve{\Psi}_{ k }^{\dagger} \cdot r V 1 _{4} \cdot \breve{\Xi}_{ k }+\text { H.c. }\right]
\]</span> Introducing <span class="math inline">\(\breve{\Psi}_{ k }^{T}=\left(\breve{\psi}_{ k +}^{T} \quad \breve{\psi}_{ k -}^{T}\right), \breve{\Xi}_{ k }^{T}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\breve{\xi}_{ k +}^{T} &amp; \breve{\xi}_{ k -}^{T}\end{array}\right),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\breve{\psi}_{ k \pm}^{T}=\left(\breve{\psi}_{ k \pm, A} \quad \breve{\psi}_{ k \pm, B}\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\breve{\xi}_{ k \pm}^{T}=\left(\breve{\xi}_{ k \pm, A} \quad \breve{\xi}_{ k \pm, B}\right),\)</span> we find that the strong-coupling Hamiltonian can straightforwardly be written in the <span class="math inline">\(|\pm D\rangle\)</span> basis as <span class="math inline">\(H^{s}=\sum_{a=\pm} H _{a}^{s}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
H _{a}^{s}=\sum_{ k , a=\pm}\left(\breve{\psi}_{ k a}^{\dagger} \quad \breve{\xi}_{ k a}^{\dagger}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}
h_{ k a}-\mu 1 _{2} &amp; V_{s} 1 _{2} \\
V_{s} 1 _{2} &amp; E_{s} 1 _{2}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\breve{\psi}_{ k a} \\

\end{array}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(V_{s} \equiv r V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_{s} \equiv E_{d}+\ell .\)</span> Straightforward diagonalization of the strong-coupling Hamiltonian yields a set of four quasiparticle bands for each spin sector as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E _{\pm D}^{(\tau, \alpha)}( k ) &amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left[E_{s}+\tilde{\varepsilon}_{\pm D}^{\tau}+\alpha \sqrt{\left(E_{s}-\tilde{\varepsilon}_{\pm D}^{\tau}\right)^{2}+4 V_{s}^{2}}\right] \\
\tilde{\varepsilon}_{\pm D}^{\tau} &amp;=\varepsilon_{\pm D}^{\tau}-\mu \\
\varepsilon_{\pm D}^{\tau} &amp;=\tau \sqrt{u_{1}( k )^{2}+u_{2}( k )^{2}+(m \pm \lambda D( k ))^{2}}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\tau=(+,-),\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=(+,-)\)</span> indexes the upper/lower quartet of bands, respectively. To gain a deeper understanding of the gap structure of the hybridized bands, it is more convenient to first diagonalize the conduction electron part of the Hamiltonian, which is possible since the off-diagonal blocks and the bottom right block are all proportional to <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> identity matrices. Diagonalizing the conduction electron part of the Hamiltonian, we can rewrite the strong coupling Hamiltonian in a diagonal form, <span class="math display">\[
h_{ k \pm}^{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\varepsilon_{\pm D}^{+} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \varepsilon_{\pm D}^{-}
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> and in the new basis, the Hamiltonian becomes <span class="math display">\[
H _{\pm}^{s}=\sum_{ k }\left(\left(\psi_{ k \pm}^{D}\right)^{\dagger} \quad\left(\xi_{ k \pm}^{D}\right)^{\dagger}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}

\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{ k \pm}^{D} \\
\xi_{ k \pm}^{D}
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> We can then directly see that the matrix elements associated with the 1 st and 3 rd fields are decoupled from the 2 nd and 4 th fields, which means we can simplify the <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> matrix in either <span class="math inline">\(|\pm D\rangle\)</span> sector, to be two <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrices, which allows us to examine the eigenenergy bands analytically. Below, we discuss the cases in different <span class="math inline">\(|\pm D\rangle\)</span> sectors separately. Our main conclusion below is that the Weyl-Kondo semimetal phase can only occur at the <span class="math inline">\(|-D\rangle\)</span> sector in the hybridized band regime, and the hybridized bands in <span class="math inline">\(|+D\rangle\)</span> sector always remain gapped. <span class="math inline">\(|+D\rangle\)</span> sector: For further analysis in the band gaps, we assume that <span class="math inline">\(E_{s}\)</span> lies well below the conduction electron bands <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{\pm D}^{\tau} .\)</span> In addition, for the condition for <span class="math inline">\(1 / 4\)</span> -filling, <span class="math inline">\(E_{s}\)</span> is required to be positive <span class="math inline">\(E_{s}&gt;0 .\)</span> Focusing on the two <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrices of the <span class="math inline">\(|+D\rangle\)</span> sector, we can separate the Hamiltonian into <span class="math inline">\(H _{+}^{s}=\sum_{\alpha, \tau} H_{+, \alpha}^{s, \tau},\)</span> the energies obtained are <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l} 
E _{+D}^{(+, \alpha)}=\frac{1}{2}\left[E_{s}+\tilde{\varepsilon}_{+D}^{+}+\alpha \sqrt{\left(E_{s}-\tilde{\varepsilon}_{+D}^{+}\right)^{2}+4 V_{s}^{2}}\right] \\
E _{+D}^{(-, \alpha)}=\frac{1}{2}\left[E_{s}+\tilde{\varepsilon}_{+D}^{-}+\alpha \sqrt{\left(E_{s}-\tilde{\varepsilon}_{+D}^{-}\right)^{2}+4 V_{s}^{2}}\right]
\end{array}
\]</span> since <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{+D}^{+}&gt;\varepsilon_{+D}^{-},\)</span> we can see <span class="math inline">\(E _{+D}^{(+,+)}&gt; E _{+D}^{(-,-)}\)</span> and these two bands always remain gapped. Similarly, within each pair of branches <span class="math inline">\(E _{+D}^{(\tau,+)}&gt; E _{+D}^{(\tau,-)},\)</span> and they should be always gapped. The only possibility that the gap closes occurs between <span class="math inline">\(E _{+D}^{(+,-)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E _{+D}^{(-,+)} .\)</span> If there is a crossing between them at some momenta <span class="math inline">\(k = k _{0}\)</span>, the two bands should be degenerate <span class="math inline">\(E _{+D}^{(+,-)}\left( k _{0}\right)= E _{+D}^{(-,+)}\left( k _{0}\right),\)</span> which leads to <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\varepsilon_{+D}^{+}\left( k _{0}\right)-\varepsilon_{+D}^{-}\left( k _{0}\right) &amp;=\sqrt{\left(E_{s}-\tilde{\varepsilon}_{+D}^{+}\left( k _{0}\right)\right)^{2}+4 V_{s}^{2}}+\sqrt{\left(E_{s}-\tilde{\varepsilon}_{+D}^{-}\left( k _{0}\right)\right)^{2}+4 V_{s}^{2}} \\
&amp; \geq \varepsilon_{+D}^{+}\left( k _{0}\right)+\varepsilon_{+D}^{-}\left( k _{0}\right)-2 E_{s} \\
&amp; \Rightarrow \varepsilon_{+D}^{-}\left( k _{0}\right) \leq E_{s}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where we use the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(E_{s}&lt;\epsilon_{\pm D}^{\tau}\)</span> in the second line. This in turn leads to a contradiction to our initial condition that the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> fermion Fermi energy is well below the four conduction electron bands, <span class="math inline">\(E_{s}&lt;\varepsilon_{\pm D}^{\tau} .\)</span> Therefore, we conclude that there cannot be any crossing between <span class="math inline">\(E _{+D}^{(+,-)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E _{+D}^{(-,+)} .\)</span> The hybridized bands in the <span class="math inline">\(|+D\rangle\)</span> sector always remain gapped at any momenta and Weyl nodes cannot reside there. Now let's examine the <span class="math inline">\(|-D\rangle\)</span> sector. <span class="math display">\[
|-D\rangle \text { sector: }
\]</span> In the <span class="math inline">\(|-D\rangle\)</span> sector, we can also decompose the <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> Hamiltonian matrix to two <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrices, <span class="math inline">\(H _{+}^{s}=\sum_{\alpha, \tau} H_{+, \alpha}^{s, \tau},\)</span> which gives the eigenvalues as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l} 
E _{-D}^{(+, \alpha)}=\frac{1}{2}\left[E_{s}+\tilde{\varepsilon}_{-D}^{+}+\alpha \sqrt{\left(E_{s}-\tilde{\varepsilon}_{-D}^{+}\right)^{2}+4 V_{s}^{2}}\right] \\
E _{-D}^{(-, \alpha)}=\frac{1}{2}\left[E_{s}+\tilde{\varepsilon}_{-D}^{-}+\alpha \sqrt{\left(E_{s}-\tilde{\varepsilon}_{-D}^{-}\right)^{2}+4 V_{s}^{2}}\right]
\end{array}
\]</span> The bands' dispersions associated with the conduction electrons show Weyl nodes at certain momenta, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(k = k _{W},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{-D}^{+}\left( k _{W}\right)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{-D}^{-}\left( k _{W}\right)=0 .\)</span> There are actually 12 inequivalent <span class="math inline">\(k _{W}\)</span> along the <span class="math inline">\(X-W\)</span> lines on the <span class="math inline">\(3 D\)</span> BZ boundary, determined by the condition <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{4|\lambda|}=\sin \left(\frac{k_{0}}{2}\right),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k _{W}\)</span> is a cyclic permutation of the elements in a vector <span class="math inline">\(\left(k_{0}, 0, \pm 2 \pi\right) .\)</span> At <span class="math inline">\(k = k _{W},\)</span> in the hybridized bands we then have <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l} 
E _{-D}^{(+,+)}\left( k _{W}\right)= E _{-D}^{(-,+)}\left( k _{W}\right) \\
E _{-D}^{(+,-)}\left( k _{W}\right)= E _{-D}^{(-,-)}\left( k _{W}\right)
\end{array}
\]</span> We can see that in the hybridized bands, there are actually two pairs of degenerate bands sitting at the momenta <span class="math inline">\(k _{W}\)</span>. Near <span class="math inline">\(k _{W},\)</span> the band dispersions can be linearized.</p>
<p>Due to the constraints in the strong-coupling regime, <span class="math inline">\(H _{a}^{s}\)</span> must be solved self-consistently with the saddle-point equations, <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{2 N u} \sum_{ k , a=\pm}\left\langle\breve{\xi}_{ k a}^{\dagger} \breve{\xi}_{ k a}\right\rangle+r^{2}=1, \quad \frac{V}{4 N_{u}} \sum_{ k , a=\pm}\left[\left\langle\breve{\psi}_{ k a}^{\dagger} \breve{\xi}_{ k a}\right\rangle+\text { H.c. }\right]+r \ell=0
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(N_{u}\)</span> is the number of the unit cell. Here we can tune the chemical potential to be <span class="math inline">\(\mu=-V_{s}^{2} / E_{s},\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(E_{s}&gt;0 .\)</span> This fixes the lower Weyl node to the Fermi energy, at <span class="math inline">\(1 / 4\)</span> -filling, as shown in Fig. 2 of the main text. For the illustration in the main texts, we use the same bare coupling parameters to be <span class="math inline">\(\left(t, \lambda, E_{d}, V\right)=(1,0.5,1,-6,6.6),\)</span> and solved self-consistently for <span class="math inline">\(r \simeq 0.259\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ell \simeq 6.334,\)</span> with error <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon \leq O \left(10^{-5}\right)\)</span> on a <span class="math inline">\(64 \times 64 \times 64\)</span> unit cell diamond lattice.</p>

<p>Following the approach in Ref. (5), we also seek surface states in the <span class="math inline">\(|-D\rangle\)</span> sector near the Weyl nodes. The nodes are on the square faces of the fcc Brillouin zone boundary, along the lines connecting high symmetry points <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>.

<p>Generalizing the wavefunction suggested in Ref. (5), we find the surface eigenstates in the plane of the four Weyl nodes around the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> point to be <span class="math display">\[

<p>The noncentrosymmetric diamond lattice (the "zincblende" lattice) is presented in Fig. S1(a). Although the diamond and zincblende lattices are structurally the same, the different on-site potential <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> reduces the <span class="math inline">\(O_{h}\)</span> cubic point group symmetry of the diamond lattice to tetragonal <span class="math inline">\(T_{d}\)</span> symmetry in the zincblende. The simplest way to visualize the inversion symmetry-breaking introduced by the <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> term is to compare the interlocked sublattice unit cells under the inversion operations in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(S 1( b ) .\)</span> If one reflects the position of any site across the indicated inversion center 'X', the upper four sites neatly exchange positions with the lower four. Conversely, if the on-site potential differentiates the sublattices via <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> an inversion operation exchanges the distinct sublattice sites, as seen in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(S 1( c ),\)</span> so the inversion symmetry is broken.</p>
<p>Here we show an example of a Weyl semimetal phase in the broken time reversal symmetry <span class="math inline">\(( M \neq 0),\)</span> in the case of the diamond lattice <span class="math inline">\((m=0) .\)</span> For simplicity, below we choose <span class="math inline">\(M=M_{z} \hat{z}\)</span> and the second term becomes a Zeeman-like term. Following the same procedure as before, we introduce the basis in momentum space <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{ k }^{T}=\left(\begin{array}{lll}c_{ k \uparrow}, A &amp; c_{ k \uparrow, B} &amp; c_{ k \downarrow, A} &amp; \left.c_{ k _{\downarrow}, B}\right) . \text { The Hamiltonian of the conduction electron }\end{array}\right.\)</span> becomes <span class="math inline">\(H_{c, M}^{T R B}=\Psi_{ k }^{\dagger} \cdot h_{c}^{T R B} \cdot \Psi_{ k },\)</span> with <span class="math display">\[
h_{c}^{T R B}=\sigma_{0}\left[u_{1}( k ) \tau_{x}+u_{2}( k ) \tau_{y}\right]+M_{z} \sigma_{z} \tau_{0}+\lambda[ D ( k ) \cdot \sigma ] \tau_{z}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(u_{1 / 2}\)</span> and vector <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> are defined in the main text. A <span class="math inline">\(3 D\)</span> Dirac semimetal is realized with Dirac points located at <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> points in the absence of the TRB term, as illustrated in Fig. S2(a).</p>
<p>Upon increasing the TRB term, first we observe that Weyl nodes appear along <span class="math inline">\(X-\Gamma\)</span> lines and along <span class="math inline">\(X-W\)</span> lines on the <span class="math inline">\(3 D\)</span> BZ boundary parallel to <span class="math inline">\(\hat{k}_{z}\)</span> -axis, and increasing to <span class="math inline">\(M_{z}=3\)</span> moves both Weyl nodes toward the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> point, illustrated in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(S 2( b )\)</span></p>
<p>Next, we analyze the critical value of <span class="math inline">\(M_{z}\)</span> signaling the phase transition that separates the aforementioned TRB-Weyl semimetals from the topologically trivial insulator phase. Focusing on one of the <span class="math inline">\(X-\Gamma\)</span> lines that we suspect to harbor Weyl nodes, we assume its position is at <span class="math inline">\(k _{W}= k _{X}-\delta k ,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k _{X}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> -point momentum, and <span class="math inline">\(\delta k =\left(\delta k_{x}, 0,0\right)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\left|\delta k_{x}\right|&gt;0 .\)</span> We can then straightforwardly find that all the components of <span class="math inline">\(D ( k )\)</span> along that line vanish. The Hamiltonian matrix along the line can be simplified to be <span class="math display">\[
\left.h_{c}^{T R B}\right|_{X \Gamma}=2 t \sigma_{0}\left[\left(1-\cos \left(\frac{\delta k_{x}}{2}\right)\right) \tau_{x}+\sin \left(\frac{\delta k_{x}}{2}\right) \tau_{y}\right]+M_{z} \sigma_{z} \tau_{0}
\]</span> which leads to the eigenvalues <span class="math display">\[
E_{c}^{T R B, \sigma}=\sigma M_{z} \pm 2 \sqrt{2\left[1-\cos \left(\frac{\delta k_{x}}{2}\right)\right]}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=\pm\)</span> for spin=<span class="math inline">\(, \downarrow .\)</span> For <span class="math inline">\(M_{z}&gt;0,\)</span> we can see that gaplessness can only occur when <span class="math inline">\(M_{z}=2 \sqrt{2\left[1-\cos \frac{\delta k_{x}}{2}\right]},\)</span> which leads to the condition <span class="math display">\[
\cos \left(\frac{\delta k_{x}}{2}\right)=1-\frac{M_{z}^{2}}{8}
\]</span> Therefore, we can see that the condition can be satisfied for <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;M_{z} \leq M_{z}^{c}=4,\)</span> after which the absolute value of the right hand side becomes greater than 1 and the condition can no longer be held.

\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{ k }\)</span> is the energy dispersion, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the energy density, and the integral is over the first Brillouin zone. Here the occupation distribution function <span class="math inline">\(f\left(\varepsilon_{ k }\right)\)</span> is the Fermi function. We focus on the linear dispersion regime where we can approximate <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{ k }=\hbar v^{*} k .\)</span> We will take the renormalized Fermi velocity <span class="math inline">\(v^{*}\)</span> for its asymptotic low-temperature value. Analyzing the temperature dependence of the condensate amplitude in our saddle-point analysis will only cause subleading corrections to the temperature dependence of the specific heat. The result for the specific heat per unit volume is <span class="math display">\[
c_{v}=\frac{7 \pi^{2}}{30} k_{B}\left(\frac{k_{B} T}{\hbar v^{*}}\right)^{3}
\]</span> This shows that the <span class="math inline">\(T^{3}\)</span> contribution to the specific heat becomes large when <span class="math inline">\(v^{*}\)</span> is small, as in the case of heavy fermion systems. In the above calculation, we have assumed that the leading term of the specific heat at low temperatures is independent of the quasiparticle weight or the residual interactions of the nodal excitations. This is because the entropy counts the number of the degrees of freedom that are thermally excited within an energy range of about <span class="math inline">\(k_{B} T .\)</span> To put this argument on a more concrete footing, we turn to an alternative calculation.</p>
<h2 id="weyl费米子比热的费米液体方法">Weyl费米子比热的费米液体方法</h2>
<p>Adopting the Fermi-liquid approach for calculating the entropy, as outlined in Ref. (6) (chapter <span class="math inline">\(4,\)</span> section 19), we express the specific heat per unit volume from a Weyl fermion as <span class="math display">\[
c_{v}=\int \frac{d^{3} k }{(2 \pi)^{2}} \frac{1}{2 \pi i T} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \varepsilon\left[-\frac{\partial f(\varepsilon)}{\partial \varepsilon}\right]\left[\ln G_{R}( k , \varepsilon)-\ln G_{A}( k , \varepsilon)\right] d \varepsilon
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the temperature, <span class="math inline">\(k_{B}\)</span> is the Boltzmann constant, and <span class="math inline">\(f(\varepsilon)\)</span> is the Fermi distribution function. In addition, <span class="math inline">\(G_{R}( k , \varepsilon)=Z /\left(\varepsilon-\xi_{ k }+\right.\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\left.i 0^{+}\right),\)</span> is the retarded Green function of Fermi liquid quasi-particles, with <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> being the quasi-particle weight, and <span class="math inline">\(\xi_{ k }=\hbar v^{*}| k | \equiv \hbar v^{*} k\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\xi_{ k }&gt;0\left(\xi_{ k }=-\hbar v^{*} k\right.\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\left.\xi_{ k }&lt;0\right),\)</span> i.e., a Weyl fermion dispersion. Likewise, the advanced Green function is <span class="math inline">\(G_{A}=G_{R}^{*},\)</span> and we set the chemical potential <span class="math inline">\(\mu=0\)</span>, sitting exactly at the nodal point. We use the Sommerfeld expansion <span class="math display">\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d \varepsilon u(\varepsilon)\left[\frac{\partial f(\varepsilon)}{\partial \varepsilon}\right] \simeq-u(0)-\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}\left(k_{B} T\right)^{2}\left(\frac{\partial^{2} u(\varepsilon)}{\partial \varepsilon^{2}}\right)_{\varepsilon=0}-\frac{7 \pi^{4}}{360}\left(k_{B} T\right)^{4}\left(\frac{\partial^{4} u(\varepsilon)}{\partial \varepsilon^{4}}\right)_{\varepsilon=0}+\cdots
\]</span> Taking derivatives and setting <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon=0,\)</span> we obtain <span class="math display">\[
c_{v}=\int \frac{d^{3} k }{(2 \pi)^{3}} k_{B}\left[\frac{\pi}{3} k_{B} T \operatorname{Im}\left(G_{R}^{-1} \partial_{\varepsilon} G_{R}\right)_{\varepsilon=0}+\frac{7 \pi^{4}}{90}\left(k_{B} T\right)^{3} \operatorname{Im}\left(G_{R}^{-1} \partial_{\varepsilon}^{3} G_{R}+2 G_{R}^{-3}\left(\partial_{\varepsilon} G_{R}\right)^{3}-3 G_{R}^{-2} \partial_{\varepsilon} G_{R} \partial_{\epsilon}^{2} G_{R}\right)_{\varepsilon=0}\right], \quad[ S 32
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Im}(A)\)</span> means the imaginary part of <span class="math inline">\(A .\)</span> For a Weyl fermion, we find that <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Im}\left[G_{R}^{-1} \partial_{\varepsilon} G_{R}\right]=\pi \delta\left(\varepsilon-\xi_{ k }\right),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\delta(x)\)</span> is the Dirac delta function; the identity <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{x+i 0^{+}}= P _{v}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)-i \pi \delta(x)
\]</span> has been used, with <span class="math inline">\(P _{v}\)</span> denoting principal value. For the leading linear- <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> term, the integral involves <span class="math display">\[
\int \frac{4 \pi k^{2} d k}{(2 \pi)^{3}} \delta\left(\xi_{ k }\right)=0
\]</span> and therefore the leading linear-in- <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> term vanishes. For the second term above, we find that <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
G_{R}^{-1} \partial_{\varepsilon}^{3} G_{R}+2 G_{R}^{-3}\left(\partial_{\varepsilon} G_{R}\right)^{3}-3 G_{R}^{-2} \partial_{\varepsilon} G_{R} \partial_{\varepsilon}^{2} G_{R}=-2\left[ P _{v}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon-\xi_{ k }}\right)-i \pi \delta\left(\varepsilon-\xi_{ k }\right)\right]^{3} \\
=-2\left[ P _{v}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon-\xi_{ k }}\right)^{3}+3 P _{v}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon-\xi_{ k }}\right)^{2}(-i \pi) \delta\left(\varepsilon-\xi_{ k }\right)+3 P _{v}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon-\xi_{ k }}\right)(-i \pi)^{2} \delta^{2}\left(\varepsilon-\xi_{ k }\right)+\left(-i \pi \delta\left(\varepsilon-\xi_{ k }\right)\right)^{3}\right]
\end{array}
\]</span> Focusing on the imaginary terms, we find that only the second term in Eq. (S35) contributes to the results. The last term vanishes because the integral of cubic delta function is zero. Therefore, we find that <span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{Im}\left(G_{R}^{-1} \partial_{\varepsilon}^{3} G_{R}+2 G_{R}^{-3}\left(\partial_{\varepsilon} G_{R}\right)^{3}-3 G_{R}^{-2} \partial_{\varepsilon} G_{R} \partial_{\epsilon}^{2} G_{R}\right)_{\varepsilon=0}=6 \pi P _{v}\left(\frac{1}{\xi_{ k }}\right)^{2} \delta\left(\xi_{ k }\right)
\]</span> Combining all these, we obtain the specific heat per unit volume as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
c_{v} &amp; \simeq \frac{7 \pi^{4}}{15} k_{B}\left(k_{B} T\right)^{3} \int \frac{d^{3} k }{(2 \pi)^{3}} P _{v}\left(\frac{1}{\xi_{ k }}\right)^{2} \delta\left(\xi_{ k }\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{7 \pi^{4}}{90} k_{B}\left(k_{B} T\right)^{3} \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{4 \pi k^{2} d k}{(2 \pi)^{3}} \frac{2}{\left(\hbar v^{*} k\right)^{2}} \delta\left(\hbar v^{*} k\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{7 \pi^{2}}{30} k_{B}\left(\frac{k_{B} T}{\hbar v^{*}}\right)^{3}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> i.e., the same expression as in Eq. (S29). It is worth noting that i) the principal value evaluation is not necessary since the <span class="math inline">\(k^{2}\)</span> in the denominator cancel the <span class="math inline">\(k^{2}\)</span> from the numerator; ii) the factor <span class="math inline">\(1 / 2\)</span> in front of the integral in Eq. (S38) is due to the extension of integration range from <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span> while recognizing that the function is even; and iii) the factor of 2 in the numerator of <span class="math inline">\(2 /\left(\hbar v^{*} k\right)^{2}\)</span> inside the integral in Eq. (S38) is originated from the fact that, for each momentum <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, there are two contribution from <span class="math inline">\(\xi_{ k }=\pm \hbar v^{*} k\)</span> in the Weyl fermion band distribution. In summary, the Femi liquid analysis here demonstrates that, even when the Fermi-liquid effects (the quasiparticle weight and residual interactions of the nodal excitations) are explicitly taken into account, the leading renormalization effect to the specific heat is still for the <span class="math inline">\(T^{3}\)</span> coefficient and has the form <span class="math inline">\(\left(1 / v^{*}\right)^{3}\)</span>.</p>
