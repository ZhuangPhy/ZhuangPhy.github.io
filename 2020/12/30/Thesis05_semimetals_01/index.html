<h2 id="摘要">摘要</h2>
<p>There is considerable current interest to explore electronic topology in strongly correlated metals, with heavy fermion systems providing a promising setting. Recently, a Weyl-Kondo semimetal phase has been concurrently discovered in theoretical and experimental studies. The theoretical work was carried out in a Kondo lattice model that is time-reversal invariant but inversion-symmetry breaking. In this paper, we show in some detail how nonsymmorphic space-group symmetry and strong correlations cooperate to form Weyl nodal excitations with highly reduced velocity and pin the resulting Weyl nodes to the Fermi energy. A tilted variation of the Weyl-Kondo solution is further analyzed here, following the recent consideration of such effect in the context of understanding a large spontaneous Hall effect in <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3}\)</span> (Dzsaber <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al., arXiv:1811.02819). We discuss the implications of our results for the enrichment of the global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals, and for the space-group symmetry enforcement of topological semimetals in other strongly correlated settings.</p>
<h2 id="简介">1简介</h2>
<p>Strong correlations give rise to a plethora of ground states and, correspondingly, a variety of quantum phase transitions. Heavy fermion metals have provided a canonical setting to study strong correlation physics, including quantum critical points and emergent phases. <span class="math inline">\(^{1-3}\)</span> Typically, in these systems, <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> electrons have a local Coulomb repulsion that is large compared to their bandwidth. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{4}\)</span> Due to such strong correlations, the <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> electrons act as local moments, which are Kondocoupled to a band of background conduction electrons. The local moments can form a Kondo singlet with the spins of the conduction electrons by the Kondo coupling, or they may condense into an antiferromagnetic order through their Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{5}\)</span> Correspondingly, antiferromagnetic quantum critical points often develop in heavy fermion metals, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). A global phase diagram has been advanced <span class="math inline">\(^{6-11}\)</span> as shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1( b ) .\)</span> It features quantum phases that are distinct not only by the existence or absence of antiferromagnetic order, but also by the Kondo entanglement and its destruction. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{12-20}\)</span></p>
<p>An intriguing problem is how the overall quantum phase diagram of heavy fermion metals is enriched by phases that are topologically non-trivial, when the strong correlations interplay with a large spin-orbit coupling. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{21}\)</span> This is an outstanding issue at the intersection between strong correlations and topology. From the vantage point of non-interacting topological states of matter, the typical questions of interest concern the effect of electron correlations on non-interacting topological states, such as non-interacting topological semimetals, or about the type of weakly interacting topological phases that can be produced by interaction-induced broken symmetries. <span class="math inline">\(^{22-24}\)</span> However, in the present context, the question of interest is different: What type of topological metallic states can be driven by strong correlations? We address this issue in a setting where the time-reversal symmetry is preserved.</p>
<p>Recently, a Weyl-Kondo semimetal (WKSM) phase has been concurrently discovered in theoretical <span class="math inline">\(^{25}\)</span> and experimental studies. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{26,27}\)</span> This theoretical work was carried out in a Kondo lattice model that is time-reversal invariant but inversion-symmetry breaking. The defining characteristics of the Weyl-Kondo semimetal include linearly-dispersing Weyl nodal excitations with highly reduced velocity and Weyl nodes being pinned to the Fermi energy.</p>
<p>In this paper, we show in some detail the role of nonsymmorphic space group symmetry in producing these properties. We consider a periodic Anderson/Kondo model on a diamond lattice, with inversion symmetry broken by a staggered potential, at quarter filling. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{25}\)</span> Focusing on the limit of large on-site Coulomb repulsion, the model is equivalent to a Kondo lattice. In the absence of Kondo coupling, the nonsymmorphic space group symmetry generates Weyl nodes that are located far away from the Fermi energy, and the ground state is topologically trivial. Because of the Kondo effect, strongly renormalized quasiparticles are produced near the Fermi energy. When this happens, the space-group symmetry in turn ensures that the Weyl nodes develop precisely at the Fermi energy; this makes the Weyl nodal excitations to be long-lived and, hence, well-defined, even in the present strongly interacting setting. In addition, the renormalized nodal velocity is smaller than the usual non-interacting value by the ratio of the Kondo temperature to the bare conduction-electron bandwidth, which can be as large as three orders of magnitude. We will also analyze further the effect of a tilting potential <span class="math inline">\(^{27}\)</span> to the Weyl-Kondo solution itself and the Berry curvature distribution. All these properties are important in giving rise to new signatures of the Weyl-Kondo semimetal in thermodynamic <span class="math inline">\({ }^{25,26}\)</span> and transport properties. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{27}\)</span> In addition, we will discuss how these results enrich the global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals. This enrichment captures the role of spin-orbit coupling in the interplay between competing phases, all of which develop out of the underlying spin degrees of freedom of the <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> electrons. Finally, we touch upon the implications of the results for space-group symmetry enforcement of topological semimetals in the general context of strongly correlated systems.</p>
<p>To set the stage for our analysis about how the spacegroup symmetry interplays with strong correlations, we start by briefly outlining the role of space-group symmetry in the noninteracting case.</p>

<p>We focus our discussion on three dimensional (3D) crystals. In topological semimetals, the bulk already has a gapless excitation spectrum. This is to be contrasted with topological insulators, in which the bulk excitations are fully gapped and only the surface states are gapless. Both of these topological phases must have band inversion, a reordering of conduction and valence bands which allows the topological insulator surface states to connect the conduction and valence bands. In three dimensions, a quadratic Hamiltonian can be classified into a topological equivalence class depending on its nonspatial symmetries: time-reversal symmetry (TRS), particle-hole symmetry, and chiral symmetry. This is commonly known as the tenfold way, which can be applied to topological insulators and topological semimetals, and can accommodate spatial symmetries as well. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{28}\)</span> More specifically to Weyl semimetals, these are characterized by energy levels that meet in pairs of twofold degenerate points in momentum space as a result of tuning Hamiltonian parameters. Without other symmetries in the system, this requires tuning three parameters to achieve degeneracy, but space group symmetries may protect the degeneracies. <span class="math inline">\(^{29}\)</span> In the efforts to identify topological materials, several studies have applied symmetry classification criteria to space groups <span class="math inline">\(^{30-32}\)</span> and more specifically to particular lattice realizations, <span class="math inline">\({ }^{33,34}\)</span> as well as considered the fillings at which nonsymmorphic symmetries will enforce gapless phases. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{35}\)</span></p>
<p>To obtain such degeneracy, a mechanism of band inversion is a necessary but insufficient ingredient. Band inversion can occur by lattice strain, scalar relativistic effects, or spin-orbit coupling <span class="math inline">\(( SOC )^{36-38}\)</span> Given the crucial role of the <span class="math inline">\(SOC ,\)</span> the search for topological materials tends to focus on systems that are based on heavy elements with large <span class="math inline">\(SOC\)</span>. Conveniently, the lanthanides and actinides where the <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> -orbital elements as well as the often-involved heavy elements (e.g., Bi) associated with heavy fermion materials provides substantial SOC.</p>
<p>We are interested in topological semimetals in <span class="math inline">\(3 D\)</span> crystals with <span class="math inline">\(SOC\)</span> and additional space-group symmetries that can protect nodal band crossings. It turns out that many nonsymmorphic space groups can support four-dimensional irreducible representations on the zone boundaries, which produce robust symmetry protected Dirac semimetal phases, provided they do not lie along threefold or sixfold rotation axes. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{29,39}\)</span> A nonsymmorphic symmetry is a space group operation <span class="math inline">\(\{ O \mid t \}\)</span> which combines a spatial point-group operation (or nonspatial operation) <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> with a partial (non-primitive) lattice translation vector <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Spatial symmetries are group operations that rotate and reflect different lattice sites onto one another, such as an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -fold rotation about the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> th axis <span class="math inline">\(C_{n i},\)</span> or a reflection about the <span class="math inline">\(a b\)</span> plane with normal vector <span class="math inline">\(\hat{c}, m_{c} .\)</span> Respectively, the corresponding nonsymmorphic transformations are called screw operations <span class="math inline">\(\left(\left\{C_{n i} \mid t \right\}=\right.\)</span> rotation <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> fractional <span class="math inline">\(\left. t \right)\)</span> and glide operations <span class="math inline">\(\left(\left\{m_{c} \mid t \right\}=\right.\)</span> reflection <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> fractional <span class="math inline">\(\left. t \right) .\)</span> since multiple fractional translations are needed to traverse the unit cell, it is enlarged in real space, which causes the Brillouin zone <span class="math inline">\(( BZ )\)</span> to fold. This creates a new Brillouin zone boundary (BZB) where any bands that intersect it are sharply reflected back into the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span>, causing a degeneracy at the <span class="math inline">\(BZB\)</span>. For these reasons, nonsymmorphic space groups with SOC generically produce Dirac nodal band touching points or lines of degeneracy. The glide symmetry is familiar to the strongly correlated electron community of iron pnictides; there, the symmetry implies that the eigenstates come in (glide even and odd) pairs and, as a result, gives rise to an extra degeneracy at the boundary of the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span> associated with the physical two-iron unit cell. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{40}\)</span></p>
<p>With the nonsymmorphic symmetry-enforced Dirac semimetal as a starting point, a Weyl semimetal phase can arise from breaking TRS or inversion symmetry (IS). <span class="math inline">\({ }^{29}\)</span> Without the protection of space-group symmetry, one would have to resort to IS breaking (ISB) systems tuned to within a band inversion transition between a trivial band insulator and a topological insulator. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{31,41}\)</span> Bands that invert are allowed to cross because (1) the bands have different irreducible representations, such as the odd-even parity in <span class="math inline">\(s-f\)</span> coupling; (2) bands of the same irreducible representation may have 28,42 Otherwise wavefunctions that differ by a Berry phase. the noncrossing theorem requires that the bands hybridize to open a topologically trivial gap at a generic point in the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus a robust procedure is to search for space groups that anchor IS breaking or are also noncentrosymmetric, and can realize an even filling factor that is both gapless and has zero enclosed Fermi surface volume.</p>
<h4 id="b强关联性驱动的拓扑状态">B强关联性驱动的拓扑状态</h4>
<p>Given all these considerations, a topological state driven by the Kondo effect arises if one first realizes a topologically trivial ground state without the Kondo effect, and when the Kondo effect is turned on, produces a topologically nontrivial phase. Our model has a solution that corresponds to such a Kondo-driven phase. We will show that the result is robust to changes in parameters. This is because our Hamiltonian has the required crystal and local symmetries, and fulfills group-theoretical filling constraints that achieve topological semimetal phases in response to the Kondo effect. Therefore, our model illustrates that strong correlations help hone in on nontrivial topological phases in the vast multidimensional parameter space of the strong correlation global phase diagram in the presence of a large <span class="math inline">\(SOC\)</span>. In this sense, a design principle follows from our work (as well as from experiments <span class="math inline">\({ }^{26,27}\)</span> ), namely to search for topological semimetals driven by strong correlations by focusing on strongly correlated semimetals with a nonsymmorphic space group and broken inversion symmetry.</p>
<p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we first explain our model and solution method. In Sec. III, we show how the model obtains a correlations-driven topological phase transition from specific symmetry considerations (Sec. III A) and the pinning of the nodes to the Fermi energy driven by the combined effect of the space-group symmetry and strong correlations (Sec. III B). A symmetryallowed tilt term is added in the model and its role is analyzed in some detail in Sec. IV. Then in Sec. V, we discuss strong correlations-suited transport and thermodynamic signatures of WKSM phases. Finally, we close in Sec. VI by discussing heavy fermion materials as a platform for exploring topological phases, and consider the nature of topological phase transitions in the global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals.</p>

<p>The term that allows the two species to hybridize is simply <span class="math display">\[
H _{c d}=V \sum_{i, \sigma}\left(d_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{i \sigma}+ H.c. \right)
\]</span> which has strength <span class="math inline">\(V,\)</span> and in the strong coupling limit that we consider, tracks the strength of the Kondo effect.</p>
<p>To represent the localized <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> electrons, the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> -operator Hamiltonian is <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> The first term has a flat bare atomic energy level <span class="math inline">\(E_{d}\)</span> which lies far below the conduction electron bands. The second term is the Coulomb interaction with repulsion energy <span class="math inline">\(U,\)</span> which penalizes the double occupation of a site.</p>
<p>Finally, we will primarily focus on the case of quarter filling, which corresponds to total electron count of 1 per site: <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> where, <span class="math display">\[

\end{aligned}
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(N_{\text {site }}\)</span> counting the total number of sites in the lattice. The interaction <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> term is, of course, an obstruction to obtaining the eigenstates. However, in the strong coupling limit of <span class="math inline">\(U \rightarrow \infty,\)</span> one can use the auxiliary boson method <span class="math inline">\(^{4}\)</span> to treat the Coulomb term by considering it's large limit consequence, which is to only allow density configurations of single particle-per-site occupation and empty occupancy. Thus the localized species acquires a boson as <span class="math inline">\(d_{i \sigma}^{\dagger}=b_{i} f_{i \sigma}^{\dagger},\)</span> which is, at the saddle-point level, averaged over the unit cell as <span class="math inline">\(b_{i} \rightarrow\left\langle b_{i}\right\rangle=r,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;r&lt;1 .\)</span> This necessitates including a Lagrange multiplier <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> which parameterizes a constraint equation term introduced into the large <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> Hamiltonian as <span class="math inline">\(H _{s}= H + H _{\ell}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
H _{\ell}=\ell\left(\sum_{i, \sigma} f_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} f_{i \sigma}+r^{2}-1\right)
\]</span> and renormalizing the hybridization as <span class="math inline">\(V \rightarrow \tilde{V}=r V\)</span>. Put together, this gives the strong coupling Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(H _{s}\)</span>. The parameters <span class="math inline">\(x =(\mu, r, \ell)\)</span> are obtained by solving the set of saddle point equations <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\delta H _{s}}{\delta x_{i}}=0\)</span> self consistently. The parameter <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> renormalizes the localized electron's energy level to <span class="math inline">\(E_{d} \rightarrow \tilde{E}_{d}=E_{d}+\ell,\)</span> which in practice is close to <span class="math inline">\(E_{F}\)</span> (we define <span class="math inline">\(E_{F}=0\)</span> ).</p>
<p>We eliminated the need to numerically solve for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> by finding the analytical solutions to nodal points in the Brillouin zone (see Appendix A). The key step to solving for the eigenenergies is to find a suitable basis that renders the Hamiltonian separable. In Ref. 25 , we performed the canonical (unitary) transformation on Eq. (2), <span class="math inline">\(\breve{\Psi}_{ k }=S_{\sigma}^{\dagger} \Psi_{ k },\)</span> that leads to <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
H_{c} &amp;=\sum_{ k } \breve{\Psi}_{ k }^{\dagger}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
h_{ k +} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; h_{ k -}
\end{array}\right) \breve{\Psi}_{ k } \\
h_{ k \pm} &amp;=u_{1}( k ) \tau_{x}+u_{2}( k ) \tau_{y}+(m \pm \lambda D( k )) \tau_{z}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(u_{1}( k ), u_{2}( k ), D( k )\)</span> are defined for the diamond lattice in Appendix A, and the <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{i}\)</span> are Pauli matrices acting in the fce sublattice space. We have used a pseudospin basis, <span class="math inline">\({ }^{44}\)</span> defined by the eigenstates <span class="math inline">\(|\pm D\rangle\)</span> with eigenvalues <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
\frac{ D ( k ) \cdot \sigma }{D( k )}|\pm D\rangle=\pm|\pm D\rangle \\
D( k ) \equiv| D ( k )|=\sqrt{D_{x}( k )^{2}+D_{y}( k )^{2}+D_{z}( k )^{2}}
\end{array}
\]</span> Based on previous studies, 25,44 we know that the Weyl nodes only emerge in the <span class="math inline">\(|-D\rangle\)</span> sector corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(h_{ k -} .\)</span> The term <span class="math inline">\(D( k )\)</span> arises from the Fourier transform of the <span class="math inline">\(SOC\)</span> term. since the bands have a definite ordering in terms of energy (see Appendix A), we find the nodal band touchings occur only between particular bands (see Sec. III B).</p>
<p>With the number of particles per-site-per-spin (or simply fractional filling) of all fermions being <span class="math inline">\(n_{c}+n_{d}=1\)</span> and since the localized electrons' filling was fixed at <span class="math inline">\(n_{f}=1-r^{2},\)</span> this implies that the conduction electron density is <span class="math inline">\(n_{c}=r^{2}\)</span> and thus small.</p>
<h2 id="外尔近藤半金属">3外尔近藤半金属</h2>
<p>In Ref. 25 we established that our model captures a Weyl Kondo semimetal featuring Kondo renormalization-narrowed bulk and surface bandwidths, exhibiting bulk Weyl nodes and surface states with Fermi arcs. An example of the surface states and their band narrowing can be seen in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2,\)</span> in which the bandwidth of the pure surface states is renormalized by the Kondo effect.</p>
<p>The configuration of Weyl monopoles is tuned along the Brillouin zone boundaries with a quarter of the bands filled (two of eight total), which is consistent with our choice of nonsymmorphic lattice and Hamiltonian. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{31,39,45}\)</span> The WeylKondo quasiparticles form exactly at the Fermi energy, for reasons at two levels of sophistication</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the Weyl nodes appear within the Kondo resonances, which lie near the Fermi energy within a small energy window set by the Kondo temperature and</li>
<li>the space group symmetry combined with the commensurate filling puts the nodes even closer to the Fermi energy - for the exact commensurate filling, the nodes are precisely at the Fermi energy.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, the combination of the Kondo effect and space group symmetry pin the Weyl nodes to the Fermi energy. Here, we analyze the mechanism that underlies this salientfeature of the Weyl-Kondo semimetal phase.</p>
<h4 id="a通过对称性实现外尔近藤半金属">A通过对称性实现外尔近藤半金属</h4>
<p>In Sec. I A, we presented some considerations for seeking Weyl semimetals in <span class="math inline">\(3 D\)</span> crystal lattices. We now turn to the specific case of the diamond lattice.</p>
<p>The diamond lattice has space group no. <span class="math inline">\(227(F d \overline{3} m),\)</span> which is centrosymmetric, nonsymmorphic, and bipartite, consisting of two fce lattices displaced by <span class="math inline">\(t =a\left\{\frac{1}{4} \frac{1}{4} \frac{1}{4}\right\}\)</span> is the cubic lattice constant). First, consider the Hamiltonian without Kondo coupling <span class="math inline">\((V=0)\)</span> implemented on the diamond lattice, which involve four bands associated with two sublattices and two spin states, with localized <span class="math inline">\(E_{d}\)</span> levels completely decoupled from them. We consider the symmetry change as particular terms are successively added. In Fig. <span class="math inline">\(3,\)</span> the cases without Kondo coupling are shown, where the flat, trivial <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> bands are well separated in energy below the dispersive <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> bands. For the quarter-filling case we consider, the localized <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> electrons are at half filling, forming a Mott insulator, and the conduction <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> -electron bands are left completely empty, implying a topologically trivial insulator phase. If only the nearest-neighbor hopping and chemical potential terms [first two lines of Eq. (2)] are included, one has line nodes along <span class="math inline">\(X-W\)</span> as shown in the upper set of bands in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(3(\)</span> a) <span class="math inline">\(.\)</span> These fourfold degenerate line nodes crisscross the square <span class="math inline">\(BZB\)</span>, due to a combination of the nonsymmorphic symmetry, two of the mirror planes, and the <span class="math inline">\(C_{4}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_{2}\)</span> rotations.</p>
