<h2 id="chapter-8-simple-models-for-the-chern-insulator">Chapter-8 Simple Models for the Chern Insulator</h2>
<p>We are now well prepared to discuss the simplest model of a topological insulator, the Chern insulator on the square lattice.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Even though, historically, the first model of a Chern insulator was introduced by Haldane on the hexagonal lattice (which we study after the square-lattice call), a Chern insulator model on the square lattice is easier to introduce and understand.</li>
<li>Before we do that, however, we must first understand the behavior of Dirac fermions upon opening a gap in their spectrum.</li>
<li>The previous chapter focused on how to keep the Dirac fermions gapless. This chapter focuses on how to make them massive and the implications of making them massive.</li>
<li>We will learn that massive Dirac fermions in the continuum exhibit a half-integer quantum Hall effect, and we will tie up some loose ends with regard to prior cryptic statements about smooth gauge, Stokes' theorem, and others.</li>
<li>We will then show that Dirac fermions are very useful in obtaining the Hall conductance of systems that undergo a gap-closing-and-reopening transition.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="dirac-fermions-and-the-breaking-of-time-reversal-symmetry">8.1 Dirac Fermions and the Breaking of Time-Reversal Symmetry</h2>
<p>In two dimensions, the model for a continuum Dirac fermion is a variant of the general two-level Hamiltonian: <span class="math display">\[
h( k )=\sum_{i} d_{i}( k ) \sigma_{i}
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(d_{1}=k_{x}, d_{2}=k_{y}\)</span> up to a rotation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}=0\)</span>, then the Hamiltonian is gapless, whereas if <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}=M\)</span> is a constant, then the Dirac fermion is gapped. We now show that when the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> matrices correspond to spin, the first case maintains time reversal, whereas the latter breaks it. Notice that here the momentum <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a continuum variable lying in the infinite Euclidean plane.</p>
<h3 id="when-the-matrices-sigma-correspond-to-real-spin">8.1.1 When the Matrices <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> Correspond to Real Spin</h3>
<p>If the Dirac equation matrix structure comes from real spin, then we have <span class="math inline">\(T=-i \sigma_{y} K\)</span>, and we know that all three matrices <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{i}\)</span> are odd under time reversal. Then <span class="math display">\[
T h( k ) T^{-1}=-d_{i}( k ) \sigma_{i}=-k_{x} \sigma_{x}-k_{y} \sigma_{y}-M \sigma_{z}
\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is preserved, then the preceding should equal <span class="math inline">\(h(- k )=-k_{x} \sigma_{x}-k_{y} \sigma_{y}+M \sigma_{z} .\)</span> This is possible only when <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span>, i.e., when the system is gapless. Generalization to any <span class="math inline">\(d_{i}( k )\)</span> shows that if time reversal is to be preserved, then <span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{Th}( k ) T^{-1}=-d_{i}( k ) \sigma_{i}=h(- k )=d_{i}(- k ) \sigma_{i} ; \rightarrow \quad d_{i}(- k )=-d_{i}( k )
\]</span> Notice that the conditions on the vector <span class="math inline">\(d_{i}( k )\)</span> are different from the graphene case, in which the matrices <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> were not meant to represent the spin of the particle. At special points that are invariant (modulo a reciprocal lattice vector) under time reversal <span class="math display">\[
k _{\text {special }}=(0,0),(0, \pi),(\pi, 0),(\pi, \pi)=- k _{\text {special }}= G / 2
\]</span> we find that <span class="math display">\[
d_{i}( G / 2)=-d_{i}(- G / 2)=-d_{i}( G / 2)=0
\]</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>; hence the system must be gapless. This can, of course, be more simply understood by just drawing the picture of a gapped Dirac fermion and seeing that the state <span class="math inline">\(k=0\)</span> does not have a Kramers' pair. Because we are working in a spin- <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> system, this necessarily implies the breaking of time reversal.</p>
<h3 id="when-the-matrices-sigma-correspond-to-isospin">8.1.2 When the Matrices <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> Correspond to Isospin</h3>
<p>In this case, <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}=1\)</span> and the preceding condition for TR symmetry changes to <span class="math inline">\(h^{*}( k )=h(- k )\)</span>. This implies <span class="math inline">\(d_{1}( k )=d_{1}(- k ), d_{2}( k )=-d_{2}(- k )\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}( k )=d_{3}(- k )\)</span>. It then turns out that to maintain time reversal, we need <span class="math inline">\(d_{1}, d_{3}\)</span> to be even in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> but <span class="math inline">\(d_{2}\)</span> to be odd. Of course, in this case the Chern number has to vanish.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-berry-potential-of-a-two-level-system">8.2 Explicit Berry Potential of a Two-Level System</h2>
<p>Let us now try to explicitly obtain the Berry potential and Berry field strength for a two-level system. The energies of the Hamiltonian in equation (8.1) <span class="math inline">\(h(k)=\sum_{i} d_{i}(k) \sigma_{i}\)</span> , <span class="math display">\[
E_{\pm}=\pm \sqrt{d_{1}^{2}+d_{2}^{2}+d_{3}^{2}} \equiv \pm d
\]</span> The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{E_{+}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 d\left(d+d_{3}\right)}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
d_{3}+d \\
d_{1}-i d_{2}
\end{array}\right), \quad \psi_{E_{-}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 d\left(d-d_{3}\right)}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
d_{3}-d \\
d_{1}-i d_{2}
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> which are properly normalized and orthogonal. We try to compute the Berry connection: <span class="math display">\[
A_{i}( k )=i\left\langle\psi_{E_{-}}\left|\partial_{k_{i}}\right| \psi_{E_{-}}\right\rangle=\frac{-1}{2 d\left(d+d_{3}\right)}\left(d_{2} \partial_{i} d_{1}-d_{1} \partial_{i} d_{2}\right)
\]</span> We can then obtain the Berry curvature [40]: <span class="math display">\[
F_{i j}=\frac{1}{2 d^{3}} \epsilon_{a b c} d_{a} \partial_{i} d_{b} \partial_{j} d_{c}=\frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{a b c} \hat{d}_{a} \partial_{i} \hat{d}_{b} \partial_{j} \hat{d}_{c}
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{a}=d_{a} / d\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We notice that the field strength is the Jacobian of the map <span class="math inline">\(k \rightarrow d / d\)</span>, which is a map between the base manifold-a 2-D momentum space-and the target manifolda 2-D sphere <span class="math inline">\(S^{2}\)</span> -given by the equation <span class="math inline">\(d^{2}=1\)</span>. When integrated over the base manifold, the Jacobian counts the winding number of the map, which is always an integer, the Chern number.</p>
<h3 id="berry-phase-of-a-continuum-dirac-hamiltonian">8.2.1 Berry Phase of a Continuum Dirac Hamiltonian</h3>
<p>The 2-D Dirac Hamiltonian, in the continuum, corresponds to the case <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}=m, d_{1}=k_{x}, d_{2}=k_{y}\)</span>. Let us now compute the vector potential by plugging, values into this formula: <span class="math display">\[
A_{x}=\frac{-k_{y}}{2 \sqrt{k^{2}+m^{2}}\left(\sqrt{k^{2}+m^{2}}+m\right)}, \quad A_{y}=\frac{k_{x}}{2 \sqrt{k^{2}+m^{2}}\left(\sqrt{k^{2}+m^{2}}+m\right)} .
\]</span> Let us assume we are at finite chemical potential <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> larger than the mass gap <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, which endows us with a Fermi surface. Note that although we did not implicitly put the chemical potential</p>
<p>into the Hamiltonian, the Berry vector potential remains unchanged because the chemical potential is a diagonal identity matrix term and the eigenstates are not changed by diagonal terms. If the eigenstates are unchanged, the Berry potential is unchanged as well. We then would like to integrate the Berry curvature over the Fermi surface, which is an azimuthal integration over the angle at a momentum <span class="math inline">\(k_{F}=\sqrt{\mu^{2}-m^{2}}\)</span> (note that we are using <span class="math inline">\(\hbar=1\)</span> ). Hence, for the integral of the Berry potential over the Fermi surface, we obtain <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\text {Fermi surface }} d k \cdot A =&amp;\int_{0}^{2 \pi} k_{F} d \theta A_{\theta} 
\\=&amp;\int_{0}^{2 \pi} k_{F} d \theta\left(A_{y} \frac{k_{x}}{k_{F}}-A_{x} \frac{k_{y}}{k_{F}}\right)
\\=&amp;\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \frac{k_{F}^{2}}{2 \sqrt{k_{F}^{2}+m^{2}}\left(\sqrt{k_{F}^{2}+m^{2}}+m\right)} d \theta 
\\=&amp;\left.\pi \frac{k_{F}^{2}}{\sqrt{k_{F}^{2}+m^{2}}\left(\sqrt{k_{F}^{2}+m^{2}}+m\right)} \approx\right|_{m / k_{F}&lt;&lt;1} 
\\=&amp;\pi-\pi \frac{m}{k_{F}}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Notice that the Berry phase at the TR-invariant (gapless) <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span> point is <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>; this be can easily understood because <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is the only value (besides 0 ) that is TR invariant (modulo <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi\)</span> ). When time reversal is broken, the Berry phase around the Fermi surface picks up a contribution proportional to the ratio between the gap and the Fermi momentum-so if the Fermi level is really high, corresponding to large doping, then the Berry phase can be again very close to (but not equal) <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, even though the time reversal is broken.</p>
<h3 id="the-berry-phase-for-a-generic-dirac-hamiltonian-in-two-dimensions">8.2.2 The Berry Phase for a Generic Dirac Hamiltonian in Two Dimensions</h3>
<p>In the previous derivation of the Berry phase, we have assumed rotational invariance. However, around a degeneracy point or band, crossing in two-dimensions, we have the following general form for the Hamiltonian: <span class="math display">\[
h( k )=k_{i} A _{i j} \sigma_{j},
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(A _{i j}\)</span> a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix. We have neglected a possible diagonal term proportional to the identity matrix because it does not influence the eigenstates and, hence, does not enter the Berry phase. The eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(d=\sqrt{\left( A _{1 i} k_{i}\right)^{2}+\left( A _{2 i} k_{i}\right)^{2}}\)</span> and the Berry potential is <span class="math display">\[
A_{i}( k )=-\frac{1}{2 d^{2}}\left( A _{2 j} k_{j} A _{1 i}- A _{1 j} k_{j} A _{2 i}\right)
\]</span> We want to compute the Berry phase over the Fermi surface (see fig. 8.1), but, in general, the Fermi surface can be anisotropic. However, we have <span class="math inline">\(A_{i} d k_{i}=A_{\phi} k(\phi) d \phi\)</span> because an infinitesimal variation <span class="math inline">\(d k =k(\phi) d \phi \hat{1}_{\phi}\)</span> on the Fermi surface. Here, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{1}_{\phi}\)</span> is the unit vector tangential to a surface of equal energy in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -space. We have that <span class="math display">\[
A_{\phi}=A_{y} \frac{k_{x}}{k}-A_{x} \frac{k_{y}}{k}
\]</span> so the Berry phase is <span class="math display">\[
\int_{0}^{2 \pi} d \phi\left(A_{y} k_{x}-A_{x} k_{y}\right)=\int_{0}^{2 \pi} d \phi \frac{1}{2 d^{2}} k^{2} \operatorname{Det} A
\]</span> which, upon substituting for <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and using the integral <span class="math display">\[
\int_{0}^{2 \pi} d \phi \frac{1}{a \cos (\phi)^{2}+b \sin (\phi)^{2}+c \cos (\phi) \sin (\phi)}=\frac{4 \pi}{\sqrt{4 a b-c^{2}}}
\]</span> valid as long as <span class="math inline">\(c^{2}&lt;4 a b\)</span>, which is the condition of not having nodal lines, brings us to a nice expression for the Berry phase: <span class="math display">\[
\int_{\text {Fermi surface }} d k \cdot A =\pi \cdot \operatorname{sign}(\operatorname{Det} A ) .
\]</span> ### 8.2.3 Hall Conductivity of a Dirac Fermion in the Continuum</p>
<p>The Berry curvature, necessary for the Chern number, vanishes on a lattice if you have time reversal. The Dirac fermion in the continuum does not have a lattice by definition, but the same theorem applies. This can be clearly seen from the form of the Berry curvature, which needs all three Pauli matrices to enter. For the continuum Dirac Hamiltonian, using equation (8.7) we have <span class="math display">\[
F_{x y}=\frac{1}{2\left(m^{2}+k^{2}\right)^{3 / 2}} m
\]</span> In contrast to the computation of the Berry phase, we now put the chemical potential in the gap <span class="math inline">\((|\mu|&lt;m)\)</span> and integrate the Berry curvature over the occupied states (this is the Berry curvature of the occupied band): <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_{x y}=&amp;\frac{e^{2}}{h} \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int d^{2} k F_{x y}
\\=&amp;\frac{e^{2}}{h} \frac{m}{4} \int_{0}^{\infty} d x \frac{1}{\left(m^{2}+x\right)^{3 / 2}}
\\=&amp;\frac{e^{2}}{h} \frac{\operatorname{sign}(m)}{2} .
\end{aligned}
\]</span> We have arrived at the notable result that massive 2-D Dirac fermions have a Hall conductance equal to one-half times the sign of their mass. This statement is puzzling because the Hall conductance, equal to the Chern (winding) number of the filled band, has to be an integer. This is true, but only if the problem is on a lattice-in this case, the reason we get one-half is because the Dirac fermion is in the continuum and has not been regularized properly. The bands of the continuum Dirac fermion do not have a bandwidth. The Hall conductance equals the Chern number and is an integer only if the base manifold (the BZ) is compact. In the continuum, the momentum runs over a noncompact manifold (the infinite Euclidean plane), and this does not apply.</p>
<p>How does having a lattice fix things? If we are on a lattice, the bands, which in the case of the Dirac fermion have infinite bandwidth (because the dispersion is <span class="math inline">\(\left.\pm \sqrt{k^{2}+m^{2}}\right)\)</span>, must bend down due to the fact that the problem has a finite bandwidth. At the points where the bands bend down (roughly), we will get another half a quantum of Hall conductance. These highenergy fermions, which contribute to conductances, are called spectator fermions. The moral of the story is that we cannot determine the full Hall conductance of a filled band by analyzing the physics of only a small part of the band. For example, in an insulator, the vicinity of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -space point where the gap is the smallest can be modeled by a Dirac Hamiltonian. However, due to the presence of the spectator fermions just mentioned, we cannot calculate the Hall conductance of the filled lattice band just by looking at the points where the gap is the smallest and then performing the Dirac computation. The reason is that we might have some higherenergy modes that can add or subtract half-values. However, the change in Hall conductance upon closing or reopening the gap can be determined by focusing only on the vicinity of the point where the transition happens. Generically, a gap-closing-and-opening transition has to happen by varying a parameter, the mass of the Dirac fermion <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. If we go from <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> negative to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> positive (and, in the process, close the gap and reopen it), then we get the Hall conductance to change by 1 . If we knew the value of the Hall conductance before the gap-closing transition, we would be able to find the value of the Hall conductance after closing and reopening the gap.</p>
<h2 id="skyrmion-number-and-the-lattice-chern-insulator">8.3 Skyrmion Number and the Lattice Chern Insulator</h2>
<p>In the previous subsection, we saw that the Dirac fermions are nontrivial physical systems. So far we have looked at the Dirac Hamiltonian in the continuum, but it seems reasonable to assume that their lattice generalization will also yield nontrivial physics. We now would like to make the simplest lattice generalization of the continuum Dirac Hamiltonian: instead of <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}, k_{y}\)</span>, we generalize this to <span class="math inline">\(\sin \left(k_{x}\right), \sin \left(k_{y}\right)\)</span>, whereas the mass of the Dirac Hamiltonian can be generalized to <span class="math inline">\(2+M-\cos \left(k_{x}\right)-\cos \left(k_{y}\right)\)</span>. This lattice generalization becomes the continuum Dirac Hamiltonian for momentum close to <span class="math inline">\(k=0 .\)</span> As we have already shown, the Hamiltonian for an insulator (spinless) must contain two bands. The lattice generalization of the Dirac Hamiltonian is, hence, an orbital model with two orbitals per site, one of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> -type and one of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> -type (or, more generally, orbitals of different parity). The coupling between the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> orbitals thus must necessarily be an angular-momentum <span class="math inline">\(L=1\)</span> coupling; hence, the lowest-order coupling is linear in <span class="math inline">\(k\left(\sin \left(k_{x}\right)+i \sin \left(k_{y}\right)\right)\)</span>. We also add intraorbital dispersions <span class="math inline">\(2-\cos \left(k_{x}\right)-\cos \left(k_{y}\right)\)</span> because they are allowed by symmetry. Hence, to the lowest-order in Fourier modes, the Hamiltonian necessarily must look like <span class="math display">\[
H=\sin \left(k_{x}\right) \sigma_{x}+\sin \left(k_{y}\right) \sigma_{y}+B\left(2+M-\cos \left(k_{x}\right)-\cos \left(k_{y}\right)\right) \sigma_{z}
\]</span> This Hamiltonian is fully gapped except at several values of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> : at <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span>, it is gapless at <span class="math inline">\(\left(k_{x}, k_{y}\right)=(0,0) ;\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(M=-2\)</span>, it is gapless at <span class="math inline">\(\left(k_{x}, k_{y}\right)=(\pi, 0),(0, \pi)\)</span> and at <span class="math inline">\(M=-4\)</span>, it is gapless at <span class="math inline">\(\left(k_{x}, k_{y}\right)=(\pi, \pi) .\)</span> By adiabatic continuity, as long as the Hamiltonian is gapped and the gap does not close, it remains in the same topological phase. By varying the parameter <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, the model has phase transitions and different topological properties, which we now investigate.</p>
<h3 id="m0-phase-and-m-4-phase">8.3.1 <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;0\)</span> Phase and <span class="math inline">\(M&lt;-4\)</span> Phase</h3>
<p>In these two regimes, the Hamiltonian is fully gapped and the Chern number is zero, per direct computation. This can be explained in different ways. We can do a direct numerical computation using the Jacobian curvature, but this would not be very physically revealing. The most physically revealing is to realize that both <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M&lt;-4\)</span> represent Hamiltonians topologically equivalent to the atomic limit (the limit in which all hoppings are set to zero, as if the lattice constant were infinity). The <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;0\)</span> regime is topologically the same phase as the phase <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, which has trivial (momentum-independent) eigenstates and zero Hall conductance. This is, in fact, an atomic limit, which does not show anything interesting because the energy bands are flat and only on-site energies are important so the wavefunctions are completely localized on the atomic sites. Here, <span class="math inline">\(M&lt;-4\)</span> is topologically the same as <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow-\infty\)</span>, which is also an atomic limit but with the on-site energies reversed from the <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow \infty\)</span> phase.</p>

<p>Another way of understanding that the Chern number is zero is by seeing that the <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}\)</span> component of the Hamiltonian does not change sign in the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span>.

The configuration of <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}\)</span> is ferromagnetic (see fig. 8.3) for the values of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in this section, and so there is no skyrmion in <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{i}\)</span> and, hence, no nonzero Hall conductance.</p>

<h3 id="the--2m0-phase">8.3.2 The <span class="math inline">\(-2&lt;M&lt;0\)</span> Phase</h3>
<p>As we decrease <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> from the atomic limit <span class="math inline">\((M=\infty)\)</span>, at <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span> the energy gap collapses at the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma=(0,0)\)</span> point. All other points remain gapped. Hence, we need to look only for the physics around that particular point if all we care about is the low-energy structure. To find out more information,we would like to obtain the continuum Hamiltonian near that point. We expand to obtain <span class="math display">\[
H_{\Gamma+k}=k_{x} \sigma_{x}+k_{y} \sigma_{y}+M \sigma_{z}
\]</span> up to linear terms in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. At the gap-closing-and-reopening transition, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> goes from positive to negative, so the change in Hall conductance is <span class="math display">\[
\Delta \sigma_{x y}=\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{sign}\left(M_{&lt;0}\right)-\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{sign}\left(M_{&gt;0}\right)=-1
\]</span> Because we know that the initial state had zero Hall conductance, by the preceding arguments, the new state has <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{x y}=-1
\]</span> The Hall conductance corresponds to the skyrmion number in the BZ. For <span class="math inline">\(-2&lt;M&lt;0\)</span>, the configuration of <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}\)</span> looks like that in the figure <span class="math inline">\(8.3\)</span> (which was plotted in terms of <span class="math inline">\(e_{s}=M / B\)</span> ). As such, <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}&lt;0\)</span> around the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> point (at exactly that point it is equal to <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> ) and then becomes positive at <span class="math inline">\((\pi, 0),(0, \pi)\)</span>, where it becomes equal to <span class="math inline">\(2+M\)</span>. This corresponds to a skyrmion number of <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. This skyrmion number can be understood as the difference between the two meron numbers of the continuum Dirac fermions with <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M&lt;0\)</span>, which are <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, respectively (fig. 8.4). The continuum Dirac equation has a meron in it because <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}=M\)</span> is always in the same direction, but the <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}, k_{y}\)</span> point away from the origin and, at large values, become dominant over <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}\)</span>, and the vector lies in the plane. However, there is a nontrivial difference between <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M&lt;0 .\)</span> The difference between the two Hall conductances of the Dirac fermions (meron numbers) is the skyrmion number equal to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>.</p>

<p>When we decrease <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> even further, we reach another phase transition.

We can analyze what happens at this phase transition by looking only around those two points. We linearize the Hamiltonian around these points: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}

H_{(0, \pi)+ k }=k_{x} \sigma_{x}-k_{y} \sigma_{y}+(2+M) \sigma_{z}

\]</span> and we can see that the Hall conductivity of each of these Dirac Hamiltonians is <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{x y}=-\operatorname{sign} \frac{1}{2}(2+M)

<h3 id="determinant-formula-for-the-hall-conductance-of-a-generic-dirac-hamiltonian">8.4 Determinant Formula for the Hall Conductance of a Generic Dirac Hamiltonian</h3>
<p>So far, we have obtained the Hall conductance for rotationally invariant Dirac Hamiltonians. We now obtain the Chern number for the generic Dirac Hamiltonian: <span class="math display">\[
h( k )=k_{a} A _{a b} \sigma_{b}+M \sigma_{3}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A _{a b}\)</span> are numbers with <span class="math inline">\(a, b=1,2\)</span> (in a suitable <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> basis) and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the Dirac gap. The field strength reads <span class="math display">\[

<p>Going to polar coordinates <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=k \sin (\theta), k_{y}=k \cos (\theta)\)</span> we write the Hall conductance as the integral over the occupied states of the Berry curvature; using the identity <span class="math display">\[

<p>Let us further consider the behavior of the Berry potential in the Brillouin zone.

\]</span> where we have separated the well-behaved part in the first line from the part that will eventually diverge on the topologically nontrivial side (second line). As we have seen, the first transition to a nontrivial topological insulator with Hall conductance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y}=\frac{e^{2}}{h}\)</span> takes place when the mass changes sign from positive to negative and the gap closes and then reopens at the point <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>. Other phase transitions of the Chern number take place at different places in the BZ, at different values of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, but we focus instead on the transition when <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> goes from <span class="math inline">\(M=0^{+}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(M=0^{-}(\)</span> for example, pick an arbitrary small value <span class="math inline">\(M=-0.1-\)</span> adiabatic continuity guarantees that the physics will be the same in any phase where the gap does not close). Expand the second line of equation (8.31) around the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> point for <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}^{2}+k_{y}^{2}&lt;&lt;\frac{M^{2}}{M+1}\)</span> : <span class="math display">\[
\frac{k_{y}}{(M+|M|)+\frac{M+|M|+1}{2|M|}\left(k_{x}^{2}+k_{y}^{2}\right)}
\]</span> Now observe that if <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;0\)</span>, the vector potential is well defined everywhere. However, for <span class="math inline">\(M&lt;0\)</span> (and small in absolute value so that we do not close the gap at other points in the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span> and our <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> point approximation is valid), we see that <span class="math inline">\(M+|M|=0\)</span>. Hence the vector potential <span class="math inline">\(A_{x}(k)\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math display">\[
\frac{k_{y}}{\frac{1}{2|M|}\left(k_{x}^{2}+k_{y}^{2}\right)}
\]</span> and we see that if we look on the <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=0\)</span> axis, the vector potential has a <span class="math inline">\(k_{y} / k_{y}^{2}=1 / k_{y}\)</span> singularity <span class="math inline">\(\left(A_{y}( k )\right.\)</span> has a similar singularity but with <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}\)</span> switched). Hence, for the topologically nontrivial side <span class="math inline">\((M&lt;0)\)</span>, the gauge potential has singularities in the Brillouin zone.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-of-choosing-a-consistent-gauge-in-the-chern-insulator">8.6 The Problem of Choosing a Consistent Gauge in the Chern Insulator</h2>
<p>The example of the lattice Dirac Hamiltonian is well suited for understanding the issue of choosing a smooth gauge in a Chern insulator. We can show that a smooth gauge can be chosen if the system has no Hall conductance-but not if the Hall conductance is nonzero. Let us look at the Bloch wavefunction of the occupied band, <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{E_{-}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 d\left(d-d_{3}\right)}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
d_{3}-d \\
d_{1}-i d_{2}
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> and let us use the simple Hamiltonian we have used so far: <span class="math inline">\(d_{1}=\sin k_{x}, d_{2}=\sin k_{y}, d_{3}=2+M-\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\cos \left(k_{x}\right)-\cos \left(k_{y}\right) .\)</span> As we know from the skyrmion-number analysis, the Chern number equals 1 for <span class="math inline">\(-2&lt;M&lt;0\)</span> and equals <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(-4&lt;M&lt;-2\)</span>, with zero Chern number for all other values of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. We now look at the region <span class="math inline">\(-2&lt;M&lt;0\)</span> and try to physically understand the cryptic comment made early on in the book that we are unable to choose a smooth gauge over the whole BZ in this case (because the Chern number is nonzeroin this case) versus the case <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;0\)</span>, where the Chern number is zero and where we are able to find a smooth gauge. We first define the <span class="math inline">\(S^{2}\)</span> manifold <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{i}=d_{i} / d\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(d=\sqrt{d_{1}^{2}+d_{2}^{2}+d_{3}^{2}}\)</span>, and define the angles on the sphere: <span class="math display">\[
\cos \theta=\hat{d}_{3}, \quad \sin \theta \cos \phi=\hat{d}_{1}, \quad \sin \theta \sin \phi=\hat{d}_{2}
\]</span> In terms of these angles, the Bloch function of the occupied band is <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{E_{-}}^{I}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
-\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(1-\cos \theta)} \\
\frac{\sin \theta e^{-i \phi}}{\sqrt{2(1-\cos \theta)}}
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> We placed an extra label <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> on the eigenstate of energy <span class="math inline">\(E=-d\)</span> to differentiate it from the gauge-transformed eigenstate II that we will soon introduce. Notice that when <span class="math inline">\(\theta \rightarrow 0\)</span>, the eigenstate becomes <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{E_{-}}^{I} \approx\left(\begin{array}{r}
-\frac{\theta}{2} \\
e^{-i \phi}
\end{array}\right) \rightarrow\left(\begin{array}{c}
0 \\
e^{-i \phi}
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> where we have safely replaced <span class="math inline">\(\theta / \sqrt{\theta^{2}}\)</span> with 1 because <span class="math inline">\(\theta \in[0, \pi]\)</span> is positive. Notice that for <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span>, the wavefunction depends on the azimuthal angle in an ill-defined way because the azimuthal angle is not well defined. For example, at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span>, two values of <span class="math inline">\(\phi, 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, represent the same point in space, but the Bloch state has a jump from <span class="math inline">\((0,1)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((0,-1)\)</span>; hence, it is multivalued. This is one example of the fact that the wavefunction in the limit that <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span> depends on the angle <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, and hence the gauge chosen is not smooth over the full <span class="math inline">\(S^{2}\)</span>. However, we can define a gauge transformation of <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{E_{-}}^{I}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{E_{-}}^{I I}=e^{i \phi} \psi_{E_{-}}^{I}
\]</span> which gives the new Bloch state for the occupied band: <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{E_{-}}^{I I}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
-\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(1-\cos \theta)} e^{i \phi} \\
\frac{\sin \theta}{\sqrt{2(1-\cos \theta)}}
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> which is now obviously well defined at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span>. Unfortunately, it is not well defined at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\pi\)</span>, for which it becomes <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{E_{-}}^{I I}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
-e^{i \phi} \\
0
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> Hence, it has the same problem as <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{E_{-}}^{I}\)</span> had around <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span>, except now the problem is at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\pi\)</span> : the wavefunction is multivalued, depending on the <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> -direction from which we reach <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\pi\)</span>. There is no gauge in which we can make the wavefunction be well defined at both <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\pi .\)</span></p>
<p>Now comes the crucial part: for <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;0\)</span> (the phase with zero Hall conductance), we can see that <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}( k )=2+M-\cos \left(k_{x}\right)-\cos \left(k_{y}\right)\)</span> is always positive; at any point in the BZ, <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}&gt;0\)</span>. This means <span class="math inline">\(\cos \theta=d_{3} / d&gt;0\)</span> which means <span class="math inline">\(\theta \in[0, \pi / 2]\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> never reaches the south pole <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, so we can pick as a globally well-defined eigenstate the Bloch band <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{E_{-}}^{I I}\)</span>. However, if <span class="math inline">\(-2&lt;M&lt;0\)</span> (the phase of nonzero Hall conductance), then, at the point <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}(0,0)=M&lt;0\)</span> and hence <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d_{3}(0,0)}{d(0,0)}=\operatorname{sign}(M)=-1\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\pi\)</span>. Moving away from the point <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, at the points <span class="math inline">\((\pi, 0)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\((0, \pi)\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}(\pi, 0)=d_{3}(0, \pi)=2+M&gt;0 .\)</span> At the <span class="math inline">\(\pi, \pi\)</span> point, we also find <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}(\pi, \pi)=4+M&gt;0\)</span>. Hence, at those points (where <span class="math inline">\(d_{1,2}=0\)</span> ), we have <span class="math inline">\(d_{3} / d=1\)</span> and, hence, <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span>. Thus, see that in this topologically nontrivial case, the map from the BZ torus to <span class="math inline">\(S^{2}\)</span> covers both the north and the south poles; hence, neither of the two gauges found before is going to be smooth in the full BZ. If we pick <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{E_{-}}^{I}\)</span> as an eigenstate, we have a problem at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span> (point in the BZ), whereas if we pick <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{E_{-}}^{I I}\)</span> as an eigenstate, we encounter a problem at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\pi\)</span>. Because <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}(k)\)</span> changes sign in the BZ, it will cover the full <span class="math inline">\(S^{2}\)</span> sphere, and we cannot pick a global, continuous, smooth gauge. This is generic for systems with nonzero Chern numbers.</p>
<p>The Chern number of the phase <span class="math inline">\(-2&lt;M&lt;0\)</span> is the winding number of the gauge transformation relating the two wavefunctions <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{E_{-}}^{I}, \psi_{E_{-}}^{I I} .\)</span> We pick a small circle around the south pole. In the region bounded by the circle that includes the south pole, <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{E_{-}}^{I}\)</span> is well defined, whereas in the region that includes the north pole, <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{E_{-}}^{I I}\)</span> is well defined. We hence have defined a patching of the target manifold and smooth eigenstates on the two patches. On the circle, the two eigenstates are related by the gauge transformation equation <span class="math inline">\((8.38): e^{i \phi}\)</span>. The winding of this phase around the circle is equal to <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi\)</span>, and the Chern number is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2 \pi}{2 \pi}=1\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="chern-insulator-in-a-magnetic-field">8.7 Chern Insulator in a Magnetic Field</h2>
<p>We would now like to add an external magnetic field to the Chern insulator and look at the structure of the Landau levels when the system is initially in a topologically nontrivial insulator state. The generic Hamiltonian for a Chern insulator with <span class="math inline">\(M=M_{0} \approx 0\)</span> expanded around the minimum gap near the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> point is <span class="math display">\[
h( k )=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
M( k ) &amp; A_{2} k_{-} \\
A_{2} k_{+} &amp; -M( k )
\end{array}\right) ; \quad M( k )=M_{0}-B_{0}\left(k_{x}^{2}+k_{y}^{2}\right) ; \quad k_{\pm}=k_{x} \pm k_{y}
\]</span> The case <span class="math inline">\(M_{0} / B_{0}&gt;0\)</span> is a nontrivial Chern insulator because <span class="math inline">\(M( k )\)</span> changes sign at <span class="math inline">\(k=\sqrt{M_{0} / B_{0}}\)</span>. Also, <span class="math inline">\(M_{0} / B_{0}&lt;0\)</span> is a trivial insulator. We can add extra terms to the Hamiltonian, such as a full kinetic terms, etc., but this does not qualitatively change the physics presented next. Let us now apply a magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(B&gt;0\)</span> (so <span class="math inline">\(e B&lt;0\)</span>, with magnetic length <span class="math inline">\(l=1 / \sqrt{-e B}\)</span> ). We define a pair of creation and annihilation operators satisfying the commutation relation <span class="math inline">\(\left[a, a^{\dagger}\right]=1\)</span>. For the momentum in terms of harmonic oscillator operators, we have <span class="math display">\[
k_{-}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{l} a, \quad k_{+}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{l} a^{\dagger}, \quad k_{x}^{2}+k_{y}^{2}=\frac{2}{l^{2}}\left(a^{\dagger} a+\frac{1}{2}\right) .
\]</span> The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian can be determined from <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
M_{0}-B_{0} \frac{2}{l^{2}}\left(a^{\dagger} a+\frac{1}{2}\right) &amp; A_{2} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{l} a \\
A_{2} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{l} a^{\dagger} &amp; -M_{0}+B_{0} \frac{2}{l^{2}}\left(a^{\dagger} a+\frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}
\psi_{1} \\
\psi_{2}
\end{array}\right)=E\left(\begin{array}{l}
\psi_{1} \\
\psi_{2}
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> We can solve the eigenvalue equation to find <span class="math inline">\(\left(\psi_{1}, \psi_{2}\right)=\left(\theta_{1}|n-1\rangle, \theta_{2}|n\rangle\right)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(|n\rangle\)</span> are the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th Landau-level wavefunctions. Notice that, because of the presence of <span class="math inline">\(|n-1\rangle\)</span>, the preceding eigenstate is valid only for <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1 .\)</span> The energy <span class="math inline">\(E_{n}\)</span> can be obtained as a solution to the quadratic equation <span class="math display">\[
E_{n \geq 1}=\frac{B_{0}}{l^{2}} \pm \sqrt{\left(M_{0}-\frac{B_{0}}{l^{2}} n\right)^{2}+\frac{2}{l^{2}} A_{2}^{2} n}
\]</span> Energies come in pairs shifted by <span class="math inline">\(B_{0} / l^{2}\)</span>. We are left with determining the dispersion of the <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span> mode. Notice that if we were to use the preceding energy equation to obtain the <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span> energy, this would give two <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span> modes; we know this to be wrong because a single massive Dirac fermion has only one <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span> mode- for the other one, the wavefunction is identically zero. The case <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span> must be treated separately because <span class="math inline">\(|n-1\rangle \rightarrow_{n=0} 0 .\)</span> The wavefunction is then <span class="math inline">\(\left(\psi_{1}, \psi_{2}\right)=(0,|0\rangle)\)</span> (note that it is already normalized to unity). The energy then becomes <span class="math display">\[
E_{n=0}=-M_{0}+\frac{B_{0}}{l^{2}}
\]</span> Notice that if <span class="math inline">\(M_{0} / B_{0}&gt;0\)</span> (topological nontrivial), then <span class="math inline">\(E_{n_{0}}\)</span> traverses the bulk gap, as seen in figure <span class="math inline">\(8.5\)</span>. This is very different from the case of a topologically trivial insulator (such as undoped GaAs), in which the energy gap between Landau levels increases as we increase the magnetic field. This nonmonotonic dependence of the magnetic field in which the zero mode behaves differently from all other Landau levels is the hallmark of the nontrivial Chern insulator.</p>

<h2 id="edge-modes-and-the-dirac-equation"><span class="math inline">\(8.8\)</span> Edge Modes and the Dirac Equation</h2>
<p>The Dirac Hamiltonian also explicitly shows the existence of edge modes at the boundary of two insulators with different Hall conductance. For <span class="math inline">\(y&gt;0\)</span>, we consider our lattice Dirac model with <span class="math inline">\(M&gt;0\)</span> (say, <span class="math inline">\(M=0.1\)</span> ), whereas for <span class="math inline">\(y&lt;0\)</span>, we consider our lattice Dirac model with <span class="math inline">\(-2&lt;\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(M&lt;0\)</span> (say <span class="math inline">\(M=-0.1\)</span> ). The only difference between the two lattice Hamiltonians is close to the point <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, where the two continuum Hamiltonians are of Dirac form with negative and positive mass. Hence, in the continuum, the boundary between regions of Hall conductance 0 and Hall conductance 1 is modeled as a boundary between a Dirac fermion with Hall conductance <span class="math inline">\(-\frac{1}{2}\)</span> and a Dirac fermion with hall conductance <span class="math inline">\(+\frac{1}{2}\)</span>. The moral of the story is that differences in Hall conductance not absolute values are important for edge states.</p>
<p>Let us now formalize the problem. We pick a boundary between a Dirac Hamiltonian with positive mass and one with negative mass in two dimensions-we could have picked any arbitrary dimension because the problem becomes one dimensional after Fourier-transforming in the directions parallel to the translationally invariant interface: <span class="math display">\[
H(y)=-i \partial_{x} \sigma_{x}-i \partial_{y} \sigma_{y}+m(y) \sigma_{z}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m(y)&gt;0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(y&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m(y)&lt;0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(y&lt;0 .\)</span> In fact, we need this to be true only at infinity, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(m(y)&gt;0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(y \rightarrow+\infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m(y)&lt;0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(y \rightarrow-\infty\)</span>. Different interpolations of <span class="math inline">\(m(y)\)</span> would physically correspond to different boundary conditions. We look for a wavefunction solution: <span class="math display">\[
\psi(x, y)=\phi_{1}(x) \phi_{2}(y),
\]</span> which is separable, as the Hamiltonian indicates. We also look for a solution localized on the interface, because our previous experience indicates that boundaries between states of different Hall conductance carry gapless modes. This solution must be dependent on the only length scale in the problem, which is the mass gap: <span class="math display">\[
\phi_{2}(y)=e^{-\int_{0}^{y} m\left(y^{\prime}\right) d y^{\prime}}
\]</span> This solution has the desirable properties that it is localized on the edge and it is well behaved (finite) when <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> goes to <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> infinity. Also <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{1}(x)\)</span> is a two-component spinor. We look for a chiral mode of energy <span class="math inline">\(E=k_{x}\)</span>. At <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=0\)</span>, we will find a zero-energy solution. Plugging in <span class="math inline">\(\psi(x, y)\)</span> into the Schrodinger equation, we get <span class="math display">\[
-i \partial_{x} \sigma_{x} \phi_{1}(x)+m(y)\left(i \sigma_{y} \phi_{1}(x)+\sigma_{z} \phi_{1}(x)\right)=E \phi_{1}(x)
\]</span> Obviously, for a zero-energy solution (such as the one at <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=0\)</span> ), we must cancel the term that depends on the mass, which is <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -dependent and can be made very large by hand. So, we have <span class="math display">\[
i \sigma_{y} \phi_{1}(x)+\sigma_{z} \phi_{1}(x)=0 \longrightarrow \sigma_{x} \phi_{1}(x)=-\phi_{1}(x)
\]</span> with the solution <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{1}(x)=\chi(x) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1,-1)^{T}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\chi(x)\)</span> a scalar function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. This scalar function satisfies the equation <span class="math display">\[
i \partial_{x} \chi(x)=E \chi(x) .
\]</span> The solution <span class="math inline">\(\chi(x)=e^{i k_{x} x}\)</span> is a chiral propagating mode in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> -direction of energy <span class="math inline">\(E=k_{x}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="haldanes-graphene-model">8.9 Haldane's Graphene Model</h2>
<p>We finish this chapter by introducing what has historically been the first example of a topological insulator, the Chern insulator on the honeycomb lattice. In the late 1980 s Haldane wanted to mimic the integer quantum Hall effect seen in the Landau-level problem while keeping the (full, not magnetic) translational symmetry of the lattice. This is actually rather hard to do because, as we saw, magnetic fields with nonzero flux per plaquette enlarge the unit cell. The unbroken translational symmetry of the lattice is equivalent to having zero (mod <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi\)</span> ) flux per plaquette, which leads us to the rather paradoxical situation of trying to obtain Landau levels without a nonzero magnetic field. Haldane realized that time-reversal breaking, rather than overall nonzero flux per unit cell, is the essential ingredient of a nonzero Hall conductance. To keep the translational symmetry of the lattice, we need to break time reversal without a net flux per plaquette. The easiest way to do this is to put the magnetic phases on the next-nearest neighbors because going around a plaquettewill not induce any nearest-neighbor phases. The Haldane model is on the honeycomb lattice, and the Hamiltonian is <span class="math display">\[
H=t_{1} \sum_{\langle i, j\rangle} c_{i}^{\dagger} c_{j}+t_{2} \sum_{\langle\langle i, j\rangle\rangle} e^{-i v_{i j} \phi} c_{i}^{\dagger} c_{j}+M \sum_{i} \epsilon_{i} c_{i}^{\dagger} c_{i}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{i}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>, depending on whether <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is on the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> sublattice, and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the nearestneighbor-hopping energy, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is an on-site inversion symmetry-breaking term, and the new term is the next-nearest neighbor: <span class="math display">\[
v_{i j}=\operatorname{sign}\left(\hat{d}_{1} \times \hat{d}_{2}\right)_{z}=\pm 1
\]</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{1,2}\)</span> are the vectors along the two bonds constituting the next-nearest neighbors. The signs of the phases <span class="math inline">\(i \phi\)</span> are shown in figure <span class="math inline">\(8.6 .\)</span></p>

<h4 id="symmetry-properties-of-the-haldane-hamiltonian">8.9.1 Symmetry Properties of the Haldane Hamiltonian</h4>
<p>We now want to analyze the symmetry properties of the Haldane model. First, we analyze the behavior under time reversal. For time reversal to be satisfied, it would mean that <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon( k )=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(- k ), d_{1}( k )=d_{1}(- k ), d_{2}( k )=-d_{2}(- k )\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}( k )=d_{3}(- k ) .\)</span> The first three are obviously satisfied by the Haldane Hamiltonian. The last condition is satisfied only for <span class="math inline">\(\phi=0, \pi\)</span>. We now analyze the behavior under inversion. For inversion around the middle of the unit cell (matrix representation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x}\)</span> ) to be satisfied, it would mean that <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon( k )=\epsilon(- k ), d_{1}( k )=d_{1}(- k )\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(d_{2}( k )=-d_{2}(- k ), d_{3}( k )=-d_{3}(- k )\)</span>. The first three are obviously satisfied by the Haldane Hamiltonian, but the last one is satisfied only for <span class="math inline">\(M=0 .\)</span> For both <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and inversion to be satisfied, we must have both <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\phi=0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\phi=\pi\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="phase-diagram-of-the-haldane-hamiltonian">8.9.2 Phase Diagram of the Haldane Hamiltonian</h4>
<p>The interplay between the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -breaking mass term and the inversion-breaking mass gives the Haldane Hamiltonian, a nontrivial structure with three phases of Hall conductance, <span class="math inline">\(0,1,-1\)</span>, very much like in our square-lattice example. Let us see how. We could directly compute the Hall conductance of the system using our Jacobian formula, but that would not be very physically illuminating. Instead, let us again use the Dirac argument.</p>
<p>We first notice that the system still has <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry: we have proved before that the Hamiltonian without the new Haldane term has <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry, and it is trivial to check that the Haldane term is invariant upon the permutation <span class="math inline">\(\delta _{1} \rightarrow \delta _{2} \rightarrow \delta _{3} \rightarrow \delta _{1}\)</span>. The inversion- and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -breaking terms induce gap in the spectrum, and we can understand the behavior of the model by looking at gap-closing-and-opening transitions. At which point in the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span> can these transitions happen? Because the model has <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry, the gap-opening-and-closing transitions (when the system goes gapless) can happen only at the <span class="math inline">\(K , K ^{\prime}\)</span> points; thus, we focus on the Hamiltonian around those points. We expand the Haldane Hamiltonian around the point <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> to linear order: <span class="math display">\[
h( K + \kappa )=\epsilon( K )+\kappa_{i} \partial_{i} \in( k = K )+d_{a}( K ) \sigma_{a}+\kappa_{i} \partial_{i} d_{a}( k = K ) \sigma_{a}
\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\kappa &lt;&lt; K\)</span>. After tedious algebraic simplification, we obtain <span class="math display">\[
h( K + \kappa )=-3 t_{2} \cos (\phi)+\frac{3}{2} t_{1}\left(\kappa_{y} \sigma_{x}-\kappa_{x} \sigma_{y}\right)+\left(M-3 \sqrt{3} t_{2} \sin (\phi)\right) \sigma_{z}
\]</span> Around <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> we have the Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[
h\left( K ^{\prime}+ \kappa \right)=-3 t_{2} \cos (\phi)-\frac{3}{2} t_{1}\left(\kappa_{y} \sigma_{x}+\kappa_{x} \sigma_{y}\right)+\left(M+3 \sqrt{3} t_{2} \sin (\phi)\right) \sigma_{z}
\]</span> To obtain the value of the Hall conductance, as we did before, we have to start from a phase where we know the its value and trace the changes in the Chern number as we undergo gapclosing and reopening transitions. Such a phase is easy to find: we start from the case <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow \pm \infty\)</span>. In that case the wavefunction is localized on the site <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and the system is trivial, with eigenstates constant in momentum space. As such, the system has no Hall conductance. We pick <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow+\infty\)</span> as a reference point.</p>
<p>The Haldane Hamiltonian is similar to that in equation (8.28) and its Hall conductance can be readily obtained from equation (8.30). Without loss of generality, we now assume <span class="math inline">\(\phi&gt;0\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(-\pi&lt;\phi&lt;\pi), t_{2}&gt;0\)</span> and start lowering <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>. At <span class="math display">\[
M=3 \sqrt{3} t_{2} \sin \phi
\]</span> the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> Dirac fermion goes through a gap-closing-and-opening transition and the Hall conductance changes from (equation <span class="math inline">\((8.30)) \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{sign}\left(M-3 \sqrt{3} t_{2} \sin (\phi)\right)=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(-\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, with a change of Hall conductance equal to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. The gap at <span class="math inline">\(K^{\prime}\)</span> stays open for <span class="math inline">\(M=3 \sqrt{3} t_{2} \sin (\phi)\)</span>, and only <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> goes through gap-closing-and-reopening transition to give a phase with <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{x y}=-1
\]</span> As we lower <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> even more, we reach the value where <span class="math display">\[
M=-3 \sqrt{3} t_{2} \sin \phi
\]</span> at which point the <span class="math inline">\(K^{\prime}\)</span> Dirac fermion goes through a gap-closing and re-opening transition, which changes the Hall conductance by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \sigma_{x y}=1\)</span> (the point <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> remains gapped). The change in Hall conductance means that the phase <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y}=-1\)</span> before the gap closing goes to a phase with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y}=0\)</span> after the gap closing and reopening. This is also necessary because the phase <span class="math inline">\(M&lt;-3 \sqrt{3} t_{2} \sin \phi\)</span> is adiabatically continuable to the state <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, which must have zero Hall conductance. The case <span class="math inline">\(\phi&lt;0\)</span> is treated in a similar fashion to give the phase diagram in figure <span class="math inline">\(8.7\)</span>.</p>
