<h2 id="ssh-model">1 SSH Model</h2>
<p>The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Model</p>
<p>We take a hands-on approach and get to know the basic concepts of topological insulators via a concrete system: the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model describes spinless fermions hopping on a one-dimensional lattice with staggered hopping amplitudes. Using the SSH model, we introduce the concepts of the single-particle Hamiltonian, the difference between bulk and boundary, chiral symmetry, adiabatic equivalence, topological invariants, and bulk-boundary correspondence.</p>
<h2 id="the-ssh-hamiltonian">1.1 The SSH Hamiltonian</h2>
<p>The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model describes electrons hopping on a chain (one-dimensional lattice), with staggered hopping amplitudes, as shown in Fig. 1.1.</p>
<p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210527033229730.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" style="zoom:67%;" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fig. 1.1 Geometry of the SSH model. Filled (empty) circles are sites on sublattice <span class="math inline">\(A(B)\)</span>, each hosting a single state. They are grouped into unit cells: the <span class="math inline">\(n=6\)</span> th cell is circled by a dotted line. Hopping amplitudes are staggered:</p>
<ul>
<li>intracell hopping <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> (thin lines) is different from</li>
<li>intercell hopping <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> (thick lines).</li>
</ul>
<p>The left and right edge regions are indicated by blue and red shaded background.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chain consist of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> unit cells, each unit cell hosting two sites, one on sublattice <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and one on sublattice <span class="math inline">\(B .\)</span> Interactions between the electrons are neglected, and so the dynamics of each electron is described by a single-particle Hamiltonian, of the form <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}=v \sum_{m=1}^{N}(|m, B\rangle\langle m, A|+\text { h.c. })+w \sum_{m=1}^{N-1}(|m+1, A\rangle\langle m, B|+\text { h.c. }) \tag{1.1}
\]</span> Here</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(|m, A\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|m, B\rangle\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(m \in\{1,2, \ldots, N\}\)</span>, denote the state of the chain where the electron is on unit cell <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, in the site on sublattice <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, respectively, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(h . c .\)</span> stands for Hermitian Conjugate (e.g., h.c. of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha|m, B\rangle\left\langle m^{\prime}, A\right|\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^{*}\left|m^{\prime}, A\right\rangle\langle m, B|\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in C )\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>spin-less</li>
</ol>
<p>The spin degree of freedom is completely absent from the SSH model, since no term in the Hamiltonian acts on spin. Thus, the SSH model describes <strong>spinpolarized</strong> electrons, and when applying the model to a real physical system, e.g.,polyacetylene, we have to always take two copies of it. In this chapter we will just consider a single copy, and call the particles fermions, or electrons, or just particles.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>half filling</li>
</ol>
<p>We are interested in the dynamics of fermions in and around the ground state of the SSH model at zero temperature and zero chemical potential, where all negative energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are singly occupied (because of the Pauli principle). As we will show later, due to the absence of onsite potential terms, there are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> such occupied states. This situation-called <strong>half filling</strong>-is characteristic of the simplest insulators such as polyacetylene, where each carbon atom brings one conduction electron, and so we find one particle (of each spin type) per unit cell.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>phase and gauge</li>
</ol>
<p>For simplicity, we take the hopping amplitudes to be real and nonnegative, <span class="math inline">\(v, w \geq 0 .\)</span> If this was not the case, if they carried phases, <span class="math inline">\(v=|v| e^{i \phi_{v}}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(w=|w| e^{i \phi_{w}}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{v}, \phi_{w} \in[0,2 \pi)\)</span> these phases could always be gauged away. This is done by a redefinition of the basis states: <span class="math inline">\(|m, A\rangle \rightarrow e^{-i(m-1)\left(\phi_{v}+\phi_{w}\right)}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(|m, B\rangle \rightarrow e^{-i \phi_{v}} e^{-i(m-1)\left(\phi_{v}+\phi_{w}\right)}\)</span></p>
<p>The matrix for the Hamiltonian of the SSH model, Eq. (1.1), on a real-space basis, for a chain of <span class="math inline">\(N=4\)</span> unit cells, reads <span class="math display">\[
H=\left(\begin{array}{llllllll}
0 &amp; v &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
v &amp; 0 &amp; w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; w &amp; 0 &amp; v &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; v &amp; 0 &amp; w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; w &amp; 0 &amp; v &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; v &amp; 0 &amp; w &amp; 0 \\

0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; v &amp; 0
\end{array}\right) .
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="external-and-internal-degrees-of-freedom">External and Internal Degrees of Freedom</h3>
<p>There is a practical representation of this Hamiltonian, which emphasizes the separation of the external degrees of freedom (unit cell index <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> ) from the internal degrees of freedom (sublattice index <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> ). We can use a tensor product basis, <span class="math display">\[
|m, \alpha\rangle \rightarrow|m\rangle \otimes|\alpha\rangle \in H _{\text {external }} \otimes H _{\text {internal }},
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m=1, \ldots, N\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in\{A, B\} .\)</span> In this basis, with the Pauli matrices, <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{0}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right) ; \quad \sigma_{x}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}
0 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right) ; \quad \sigma_{y}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; -i \\
i &amp; 0
\end{array}\right) ; \quad \sigma_{z}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> the Hamiltonian can be written as <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}=v \sum_{m=1}^{N}|m\rangle\langle m| \otimes \hat{\sigma}_{x}+w \sum_{m=1}^{N-1}\left(|m+1\rangle\langle m| \otimes \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{x}+i \hat{\sigma}_{y}}{2}+\text { h.c. }\right)
\]</span> The intracell hopping shows up here as an intracell operator, while the intercell hopping as a hopping operator.</p>
<h2 id="bulk-hamiltonian">1.2 Bulk Hamiltonian</h2>
<p>As every solid-state system, the long chain of the SSH model has a bulk and a boundary. The bulk is the long central part of the chain, the boundaries are the two ends, or "edges" of the chain, indicated by shading in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.1\)</span> We first concentrate on the bulk, since, in the thermodynamic limit of <span class="math inline">\(N \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, it is much larger than the boundaries, and it will determine the most important physical properties of the model. Although the treatment of the bulk using the Fourier transformation might seem like a routine step, we detail it here because different conventions are used in the literature. More on this in Appendix</p>
<p>The physics in the bulk, the long central part of the system, should not depend on how the edges are defined, and so for simplicity we set periodic (Born-von Karman) boundary conditions. This corresponds to closing the bulk part of the chain into a ring, with the bulk Hamiltonian defined as <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{\text {bulk }}=\sum_{m=1}^{N}(v|m, B\rangle\langle m, A|+w|(m \bmod N)+1, A\rangle\langle m, B|)+\text { h.c.. }
\]</span> We are looking for eigenstates of this Hamiltonian, <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{\text {bulk }}\left|\Psi_{n}(k)\right\rangle=E_{n}(k)\left|\Psi_{n}(k)\right\rangle,
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n \in\{1, \ldots, 2 N\}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="bulk-momentum-space-hamiltonian">Bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian</h4>
<p>Due to the translation invariance of the bulk, Bloch's theorem applies, and we look for the eigenstates in a plane wave form. We introduce the plane wave basis states only for the external degree of freedom, <span class="math display">\[
|k\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{m=1}^{N} e^{i m k}|m\rangle 
\]</span> where the wavenumber <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> was chosen to take on values from the first Brillouin zone. <span class="math display">\[
\text { for } k \in\left\{\delta_{k}, 2 \delta_{k}, \ldots, N \delta_{k}\right\} \quad \text { with } \delta_{k}=\frac{2 \pi}{N}
\]</span> The Bloch eigenstates read <span class="math display">\[
\left|\Psi_{n}(k)\right\rangle=|k\rangle \otimes\left|u_{n}(k)\right\rangle  
\]</span> The vectors <span class="math inline">\(\left|u_{n}(k)\right\rangle \in H _{\text {internal }}\)</span> are eigenstates of the bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}(k)\)</span> defined as <span class="math display">\[
\left|u_{n}(k)\right\rangle=a_{n}(k)|A\rangle+b_{n}(k)|B\rangle
\]</span> eigen-problem <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}(k)\left|u_{n}(k)\right\rangle =E_{n}(k)\left|u_{n}(k)\right\rangle
\]</span> bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{H}(k) &amp;=\left\langle k\left|\hat{H}_{\text {bulk }}\right| k\right\rangle\\&amp;=\sum_{\alpha, \beta \in\{A, B\}}\left\langle k, \alpha\left|H_{\text {bulk }}\right| k, \beta\right\rangle \cdot|\alpha\rangle\langle\beta| 
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<h4 id="periodicity-in-wave-number">Periodicity in wave-number</h4>
<p>Although Eq. <span class="math inline">\(\left|u_{n}(k)\right\rangle\)</span> has a lot to do with the continous-variable <strong>Bloch theorem</strong>, <span class="math display">\[
\Psi_{n, k}(x)=e^{i k x} u_{n, k}(x)
\]</span> this correspondence is not direct. In a discretization of the continuous-variable Bloch theorem, the internal degree of freedom would play the role of the coordinate within the unit cell, which is also transformed by the Fourier transform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, the function <span class="math inline">\(u_{n, k}(x)\)</span> cell-periodic, <span class="math inline">\(u_{n, k}(x+1)=u_{n, k}(x)\)</span>,</li>
<li>but not periodic in the Brillouin zone, <span class="math inline">\(u_{n, k+2 \pi}(x+1) \neq u_{n, k}(x)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Fourier transform acts only on the external degree of freedom, and as a result, we have periodicity in the Brillouin zone, <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}(k+2 \pi)=\hat{H}(k) ; \quad\left|u_{n}(k+2 \pi)\right\rangle=\left|u_{n}(k)\right\rangle .
\]</span> This convention simplifies the formulas for the topological invariants immensely. Note, however, that the other convention, the discretization of the Bloch theorem, is also widely used in the literature. We compare the two approaches in Appendix</p>
<h4 id="example-n4">example N=4</h4>
<p>As an example, for the SSH model on a chain of <span class="math inline">\(N=4\)</span> unit cells, the Schrödinger equation, <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{\text {bulk }}\left|\Psi_{n}(k)\right\rangle=E_{n}(k)\left|\Psi_{n}(k)\right\rangle
\]</span> using Eq.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left|\Psi_{n}(k)\right\rangle=|k\rangle \otimes\left|u_{n}(k)\right\rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left|u_{n}(k)\right\rangle=a_{n}(k)|A\rangle+b_{n}(k)|B\rangle .\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(|k\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{m=1}^{N} e^{i m k}|m\rangle\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>translates to a matrix eigenvalue equation, <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{cccccccc}

\end{array}\right) .
\]</span> The Schrödinger equation defining the matrix <span class="math inline">\(H(k)\)</span> of the bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian reads <span class="math display">\[
H(k)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}

\end{array}\right) ;\\ \quad H(k)\left(\begin{array}{l}

\]</span></p>
<h4 id="the-hopping-is-staggered-to-open-a-gap">1.2.3 The Hopping Is Staggered to Open a Gap</h4>
<p>The dispersion relation of the bulk can be read off from Eq. <span class="math display">\[

</blockquote>
<p>As long as the hopping amplitudes are staggered, <span class="math inline">\(v \neq w\)</span>, (Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.2 a , b , d , e )\)</span>, there is an energy gap of <span class="math inline">\(2 \Delta\)</span> separating the lower, filled band, from the upper, empty band, with <span class="math display">\[
\Delta=\min _{k} E(k)=|v-w|
\]</span> Without the staggering, i.e., if <span class="math inline">\(v=w\)</span>, (Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.2 c )\)</span>, the SSH model describes a conductor. In that case there are plane wave eigenstates of the bulk available with arbitrarily small energy, which can transport electrons from one end of the chain to the other.</p>
<p>The staggering of the hopping amplitudes occurs naturally in many solid state systems, e.g., polyacetylene, by what is known as the Peierls instability. A detailed analysis of this process necessitates a model where the positions of the atoms are also dynamical [32]. Nevertheless, we can understand this process intuitively just from the effects of a slight staggering on the dispersion relation. As the gap due to the staggering of the hopping amplitudes opens, the energy of occupied states is lowered, while unoccupied states move to higher energies. Thus, the staggering is energetically favourable.</p>
<h4 id="information-beyond-the-dispersion-relation">1.2.4 Information Beyond the Dispersion Relation</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the dispersion relation is useful to read off a number of physical properties of the bulk of the system (e.g., group velocities), there is also important information about the bulk that it does not reveal. Stationary states do not only have an energy and wavenumber eigenvalue, but also an internal structure, represented by the components of the corresponding vector <span class="math inline">\(\left|u_{n}(k)\right\rangle \in H _{\text {intemal }} .\)</span> We now define a compact representation of this information for the SSH model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>承上启下，讲完dispersion relation的信息之后，讲本征态的信息</p>
<p>The bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}(k)\)</span> of any two-band model (i.e., a model with 2 internal states per unit cell), reads <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
H(k)&amp;=d_{0}(k) \hat{\sigma}_{0}+ d (k) \hat{\sigma}\\&amp;=d_{0}(k) \hat{\sigma}_{0}+d_{x}(k) \hat{\sigma}_{x}+d_{y}(k) \hat{\sigma}_{y}+d_{z}(k) \hat{\sigma}_{z}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> For the SSH model, <span class="math inline">\(d_{0}(k)=0\)</span>, and the real numbers <span class="math inline">\(d_{x y, z} \in R\)</span>, the components of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -dependent 3 -dimensional vector <span class="math inline">\(d (k)\)</span>, read <span class="math display">\[
d_{x}(k)=v+w \cos k ; \quad d_{y}(k)=w \sin k ; \quad d_{z}(k)=0
\]</span> The internal structure of the eigenstates with momentum <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is given by the direction in which the vector <span class="math inline">\(d (k)\)</span> (the energy is given by the magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(d (k) ;\)</span> for details see Sect. <span class="math inline">\(2.5\)</span> ).</p>

<p>As the wavenumber runs through the Brillouin zone, <span class="math inline">\(k=0 \rightarrow 2 \pi\)</span>, the path that the endpoint of the vector <span class="math inline">\(d (k)\)</span> traces out is a closed circle of radius <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> on the <span class="math inline">\(d_{x}, d_{y}\)</span> plane, centered at <span class="math inline">\((v, 0)\)</span>. For more general 2-band insulators, this path need not be a circle, but it needs to be a <strong>closed loop</strong> due to the periodicity of the bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian and it needs to avoid the origin, to describe an insulator.</p>
<h5 id="bulk-winding-number">bulk winding number</h5>
<p>The topology of this loop can be characterized by an integer, the <strong>bulk winding number</strong> <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. This counts the number of times the loop winds around the origin of the <span class="math inline">\(d_{x}, d_{y}\)</span> plane. For example,</p>
<ul>

<li>in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.2 i , j\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(v=1\)</span>,</li>
<li>while in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.2 h\)</span>, the winding number <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is undefined.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="edge-states">1.3 Edge States</h2>
<p>Like any material, the SSH Hamiltonian does not only have a bulk part, but also boundaries (which we refer to as ends or edges). The distinction between bulk and edge is not sharply defined, it describes the behavior of energy eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit. In the case we consider in these lecture notes, the bulk is translation invariant, and then the we can distinguish edge states and bulk states by their localized/delocalized behavior in the thermodynamic limit. We will begin with the fully dimerized limits, where the edge regions can be unambiguously defined. We then move away from these limits, and use a practical definition of edge states.</p>
<h4 id="fully-dimerized-limits">1.3.1 Fully Dimerized Limits</h4>
<p>The SSH model becomes particularly simple in the two fully dimerized cases: if the intercell hopping amplitude vanishes and the intracell hopping is set to 1 , <span class="math inline">\(v=1, w=0\)</span>, or vice versa, <span class="math inline">\(v=0, w=1\)</span>. In both cases the SSH chain falls apart to a sequence of disconnected dimers, as shown in Fig. 1.3.</p>

<h5 id="the-bulk-in-the-fully-dimerized-limits-has-flat-bands">1.3.1.1 The Bulk in the Fully Dimerized Limits Has Flat Bands</h5>
<p>In the fully dimerized limits, one can choose a set of energy eigenstates which are restricted to one dimer each. These consist of the even (energy <span class="math inline">\(E=+1)\)</span> and odd (energy <span class="math inline">\(E=-1\)</span> ) superpositions of the two sites forming a dimer.</p>
<h6 id="trivial">(1) trivial</h6>
<p>In the <span class="math inline">\(v=1, w=0\)</span> case, which we call trivial, we have <span class="math display">\[
 \hat{H}(|m, A\rangle \pm|m, B\rangle)=\pm(|m, A\rangle \pm|m, B\rangle)
\]</span> The bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian is <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> independent of the wavenumber <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<h6 id="topological">(2) topological</h6>
<p>In the <span class="math inline">\(v=0, w=1\)</span> case, which we call topological, each dimer is shared between two neighboring unit cells, <span class="math display">\[

\hat{H}(k)=\hat{\sigma}_{x} \cos k+\hat{\sigma}_{y} \sin k

<p>In both fully dimerized limits, the energy eigenvalues are <strong>independent of the wavenumber</strong>, <span class="math inline">\(E(k)=\pm 1 .\)</span> In this so-called <strong>flat-band limit</strong>, the group velocity is zero, which again shows that as the chain falls apart to dimers, a particle input into the bulk will not move along the chain.</p>

<h4 id="moving-away-from-the-fully-dimerized-limit">1.3.2 Moving Away from the Fully Dimerized Limit</h4>
<p>We now examine what happens to the edge states as we <strong>move away</strong> from the fully dimerized limit. To be specific, we examine how the spectrum of an open topological chain, <span class="math inline">\(v=0, w=1\)</span>, of <span class="math inline">\(N=10\)</span> unit cells changes, as we <strong>continuously turn on</strong> the intra-cell hopping amplitude <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. The spectra, Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.4\)</span>, reveal that the energies of the edge states remain very close to zero energy.</p>
<p>The wave-functions of almost-zero-energy edge states have to be <strong>exponentially localized</strong> at the left/right edge, because the zero of energy is in the bulk band gap. A plot of the wave-functions (which have only real components, since the Hamiltonian is real), Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.4\)</span></p>

<p>reveals that the almost-zero-energy eigenstates are odd and even superpositions of states localized exponentially on the left and right edge. This is a result of the exponentially small overlap between the left and the right edge states. We will later show, in Sect. <span class="math inline">\(1.5 .6\)</span>, that the edge-state energies are also controlled by this overlap, and are of the order <span class="math display">\[
E=e^{-N / \xi}
\]</span> with a localization length <span class="math inline">\(\xi=1 / \log (v / w)\)</span></p>
<p>There is an important property of the left (right) edge states, which is only revealed by the plot of the wavefunctions, Fig. 1.4.</p>
<ul>
<li>The right edge state has nonvanishing components only on the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> sublattice</li>
<li>while the left edge state on the <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> sublattice.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, we show the generality of these properties, and show the link between the bulk winding number and the presence/absence of edge states, known as bulk-boundary correspondence. In the case of the SSH model, all this hinges on a property of the model known as chiral symmetry.</p>
<h2 id="chiral-symmetry">1.4 Chiral Symmetry</h2>
<p>In quantum mechanics, we say that a Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> has a symmetry represented by a unitary operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{U}\)</span> if <span class="math display">\[
\hat{U} \hat{H} \hat{U}^{\dagger}=\hat{H}
\]</span> In case of a symmetry, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{U}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> can be diagonalized together, and therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> has no matrix elements between two eigenstates of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{U}\)</span> with different eigenvalues. This can be understood as a super-selection rule:</p>
<p class="note note-primary">
super-selection rule:
</p>
<p>if we partition the Hilbert space into different sectors, i.e, eigenspaces of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{U}\)</span>, labeled by the corresponding eigenvalues, then the dynamics as defined by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> can be regarded separately in each sector.</p>
<h4 id="no-unitary-symmetries">1.4.1 No Unitary Symmetries</h4>
<p>A unitary symmetry can be simply made to disappear if we restrict ourselves to one sector of the Hilbert space. This is how we obtained the bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian, in Sect. <span class="math inline">\(1.2\)</span>, where the symmetry was the lattice translation operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{U}=|m+1, A\rangle\langle m, A|+| m+1, B\rangle\langle m, B|\)</span>, and the labels of the super-selection sectors were the quasi-momenta <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="a-different-type-of-symmetry">1.4.2 A Different Type of Symmetry</h4>
<p>The word "symmetry" is also used in a different sense in condensed matter physics. One example is chiral symmetry. We say that a system with Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> has chiral symmetry, if <span class="math display">\[
\hat{\Gamma} \hat{H} \hat{\Gamma}^{\dagger}=-\hat{H}
\]</span> with an operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma}\)</span> that is not only unitary, but fulfils some other criteria as well. Notice the extra minus sign on the right hand side. This has important consequences, which we come to later, but first discuss the criteria on the symmetry operator.</p>
<h5 id="unitary">(1) unitary</h5>
<p>First, the chiral symmetry operator has to be unitary and Hermitian, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma}^{\dagger}=\hat{\Gamma}\)</span>, which can be written succinctly as <span class="math display">\[
\hat{\Gamma}^{\dagger} \hat{\Gamma}=\hat{\Gamma}^{2}=1
\]</span> The reason for this requirement is that if the operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma}^{2}\)</span> was nontrivial, it would represent a unitary symmetry, since <span class="math display">\[
\hat{\Gamma} \hat{\Gamma} \hat{H} \hat{\Gamma} \hat{\Gamma}=-\hat{\Gamma} \hat{H} \hat{\Gamma}=\hat{H}
\]</span> This could still leave room for the chiral symmetry operator to square to a state independent phase, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma}^{2}=e^{i \phi} .\)</span> However, this can be got rid of by a redefinition of the chiral symmetry <span class="math display">\[
\Gamma \rightarrow e^{-i \phi / 2} \Gamma
\]</span></p>
<h5 id="sublattice-operator-local">(2) sublattice operator-local</h5>
<p>Second, it is also required that the <strong>sublattice operator</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma}\)</span> be <strong>local</strong>. The system is assumed to consist of unit cells, and matrix elements of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma}\)</span> between sites from different unit cells should vanish.</p>
<p>In the SSH chain, this means that for <span class="math inline">\(m \neq m^{\prime}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\langle m, \alpha|\hat{\Gamma}| m^{\prime}, \alpha^{\prime}\rangle=0
\]</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \alpha^{\prime} \in(A, B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, we can demand that the sublattice operator act in the same way in each unit cell (although this is not strictly necessary), its action represented by a unitary operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\gamma}\)</span> acting on the internal Hilbert space of one unit cell, i.e. <span class="math display">\[
\hat{\Gamma}=\hat{\gamma} \oplus \hat{\gamma} \oplus \ldots \oplus \hat{\gamma}=\bigoplus_{ - 1 }^{N} \hat{\gamma}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of unit cells.</p>
<h5 id="robust">(3) robust</h5>
<p>A third requirement, which is often not explicitly stated, is that the chiral symmetry has to be robust. To understand what we mean by that, first note that in solid state physics, we often deal with Hamiltonians with many local parameters that vary in a controlled or uncontrolled way.</p>
<p>An example is the SSH model, where the values of the hopping amplitudes could be subject to spatial disorder. We gather all such parameters in a formal vector, and call it <span class="math inline">\(\xi \in E .\)</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\)</span> is the set of all realizations of disorder that we investigate. Instead of talking about the symmetries of a Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span>, we should rather refer to symmetries of a set of Hamiltonians <span class="math inline">\(\{\hat{H}(\xi)\}\)</span>, for all <span class="math inline">\(\xi \in E .\)</span> This set has chiral symmetry represented by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma}\)</span> if <span class="math display">\[
\forall \xi \in E: \quad \hat{\Gamma} \hat{H}(\xi) \hat{\Gamma}=-\hat{H}(\xi)
\]</span> with the symmetry operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma}\)</span> independent of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>. This is the robustness of the chiral symmetry.</p>
<h4 id="consequences-of-chiral-symmetry-for-energy-eigenstates">1.4.3 Consequences of Chiral Symmetry for Energy Eigenstates</h4>
<p>We now come to the consequences of chiral symmetry, which are very different from those of conventional symmetries, due to the extra minus sign in its definition <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma} \hat{H} \hat{\Gamma}^{\dagger}=-\hat{H}\)</span></p>
<h5 id="sublattice-symmetry">1.4.3.1 Sublattice Symmetry</h5>
<p>Chiral symmetry is also called sublattice symmetry. Given the chiral symmetry operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma}\)</span>, we can define orthogonal sublattice projectors <span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}_{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}_{B}\)</span>, as <span class="math display">\[
\hat{P}_{A}=\frac{1}{2}( I +\hat{\Gamma}) ; \quad \hat{P}_{B}=\frac{1}{2}( I -\hat{\Gamma}),
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> represents the identity operator on the Hilbert space of the system. Note that</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}_{A}+\hat{P}_{B}=I\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}_{A} \hat{P}_{B}=0\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The defining relation of sub-lattice symmetry, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma} \hat{H} \hat{\Gamma}^{\dagger}=-\hat{H}\)</span>, can be written in an equivalent form by requiring that the Hamiltonian induces no transitions from any site on one sub-lattice to any site on the same sub-lattice <span class="math display">\[
\hat{P}_{A} \hat{H} \hat{P}_{A}=P_{B} \hat{H} \hat{P}_{B}=0 ;  
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}=\hat{P}_{A} \hat{H} \hat{P}_{B}+\hat{P}_{B} \hat{H} \hat{P}_{A}
\]</span></p>
<p>In fact, using the projectors <span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}_{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}_{B}\)</span> is an alternative and equivalent way of defining chiral symmetry.</p>
<h5 id="symmetric-spectrum">1.4.3.2 Symmetric Spectrum</h5>
<p>The spectrum of a chiral symmetric Hamiltonian is symmetric. For any state with energy <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, there is a chiral symmetric partner with energy <span class="math inline">\(-E\)</span>. This is simply seen, <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{H}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle&amp;=E_{n}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle \\
\hat{H} \hat{\Gamma}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle&amp;=-\hat{\Gamma} \hat{H}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle\\&amp;=-\hat{\Gamma} E_{n}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle\\&amp;=-E_{n} \hat{\Gamma}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle
\end{aligned}
\]</span> This carries different implications for nonzero energy eigenstates and zero energy eigenstates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(E_{n} \neq 0\)</span>, the states <span class="math inline">\(\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle\)</span> are eigenstates with different energy, and. therefore, have to be orthogonal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that every nonzero energy eigenstate of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> has equal support on both sublattices, <span class="math display">\[
\text { If } E_{n} \neq 0: \quad 0=\left\langle\psi_{n}|\hat{\Gamma}| \psi_{n}\right\rangle=\left\langle\psi_{n}\left|P_{A}\right| \psi_{n}\right\rangle-\left\langle\psi_{n}\left|P_{B}\right| \psi_{n}\right\rangle .
\]</span> For <span class="math inline">\(E_{n}=0\)</span>, zero energy eigenstates can be chosen to have support on only one sublattice. This is because <span class="math display">\[
\text { If } \hat{H}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle=0: \quad \hat{H} \hat{P}_{A / B}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle=\hat{H}\left(\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle \pm \hat{\Gamma}\left|\psi_{n}\right\rangle\right)=0
\]</span> These projected zero-energy eigenstates are eigenstates of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Gamma}\)</span>, and therefore are chiral symmetric partners of themselves.</p>
<h4 id="sublattice-projectors-and-chiral-symmetry-of-the-ssh-model">1.4.4 Sublattice Projectors and Chiral Symmetry of the SSH Model</h4>
<p>The Hamiltonian of the SSH model is bipartite: the Hamiltonian includes no transitions between sites with the same sublattice index. The projectors to the sublattices read <span class="math display">\[
\hat{P}_{A}=\sum_{m=1}^{N}|m, A\rangle \langle n, A |;   
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\hat{P}_{B}=\sum_{m=1}^{N} | m, B \rangle\langle n, B| .
\]</span></p>
<p>Chiral symmetry is represented by the sublattice operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Sigma}_{z}\)</span>, that multiplies all components of a wavefunction on sublattice <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\((-1)\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\hat{\Sigma}_{z}=\hat{P}_{A}-\hat{P}_{B}
\]</span> Note that this operator has the properties required of the chiral symmetry operator above: it is unitary, Hermitian, and local.</p>
<p>The chiral symmetry of the SSH model is a restatement of the fact that the Hamiltonian is bipartite, <span class="math display">\[
\hat{P}_{A} \hat{H} \hat{P}_{A}=\hat{P}_{B} \hat{H} \hat{P}_{B}=0 ;   
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\hat{\Sigma}_{z} \hat{H} \hat{\Sigma}_{z}=-\hat{H}
\]</span></p>
<p>This relation holds because <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> only contains terms that are multiples of <span class="math inline">\(|m, A\rangle\left\langle m^{\prime}, B\right|\)</span>, or of <span class="math inline">\(|m, B\rangle\left\langle m^{\prime}, A\right|\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m, m^{\prime} \in Z\)</span>. Upon multiplication from the left and the right by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Sigma}_{z}\)</span>, such a term picks up a single factor of <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> (because of the multiplication from the left or because of the multiplication from the right). Note that this relation, equivalent to an anti-commutation of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Sigma}_{z}\)</span>, holds whether or not the hopping amplitudes depend on position: therefore, the chiral symmetry represented by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Sigma}_{z}\)</span> has the required property of robustness.</p>
<h4 id="consequence-of-chiral-symmetry-bulk-winding-number-for-the-ssh-model">1.4.5 Consequence of Chiral Symmetry: Bulk Winding Number for the SSH Model</h4>
<p>We now consider the bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}(k)= d (k) \hat{\sigma}\)</span>. The path of the endpoint of <span class="math display">\[

<li>Since <span class="math inline">\(d (k)\)</span> is a directed curve, it has a left side and a right side. Paint the left side blue, the right side red, as shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.5 a\)</span>.</li>
<li>Take a directed curve <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> going from 0 to infinity. We can call this the "line of sight to infinity", although it need not be a straight line. A simple choice is the half-infinite line, <span class="math inline">\(d_{y}=0, d_{x} \geq 0\)</span>. Two other choices are shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.5\)</span>.</li>
<li>Identify the intersections of <span class="math inline">\(d (k)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</li>
<li>Each intersection has a signature: this is <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> if the line of sight meets it from the blue side, <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> for the red side.</li>
<li>The winding number <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the sum of the signatures.</li>
</ol>
<p>We now consider how the winding number <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> defined above can change under continuous deformations of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> or of <span class="math inline">\(d (k)\)</span>. We only allow for deformations that keep both curves on the plane, maintain <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> going from the origin to infinity, and do not create points where <span class="math inline">\(d (k)=0 .\)</span> Due to the deformations the intersections of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d (k)\)</span> can move, but this does not change <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. They can also appear or disappear, at points where <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d (k)\)</span> touch. However, they can only appear or disappear pairwise: a red and a blue intersection together, which does not change <span class="math inline">\(v .\)</span> As an example, the two choices of the line of sight <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.5 a\)</span>, have 1 or 3 intersections, but the winding number is <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>, for either of them.</p>
<h5 id="winding-number-as-an-integral">1.4.5.2 Winding Number as an Integral</h5>
<p>The winding number can also be written as a compact formula using the unit vector, defined as <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{ d }=\frac{ d }{| d |} \text { . }
\]</span> This is the result of <strong>projecting</strong> the curve of <span class="math inline">\(d (k)\)</span> to the unit circle, as shown in Fig. 1.5b. The vector <span class="math inline">\(d (k)\)</span> is well defined for all <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(d (k) \neq 0\)</span>. You can check easily that the winding number <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[
v=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\left(\tilde{ d }(k) \times \frac{d}{d k} \tilde{ d }(k)\right)_{z} d k

H(k)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}

h^{*}(k) &amp; 0
\end{array}\right)  
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(h(k)=d_{x}(k)-i d_{y}(k) .\)</span></p>
<p>The winding number of <span class="math inline">\(d (k)\)</span> can be written as an integral, using the complex logarithm function, <span class="math inline">\(\log \left(|h| e^{i \text { arg } h}\right)=\log |h|+i \arg h\)</span>. It is easy to check that <span class="math display">\[
v=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} d k \frac{d}{d k} \log h(k)
\]</span> Here during the calculation of the integral, the branch cut for the logarithm is always shifted so that the derivative is always well defined. The above integral is always real, since <span class="math inline">\(|h(k=-\pi)|=|h(k=\pi)|\)</span>.</p>

<p>We now introduce the notion of adiabatic deformation of insulating Hamiltonians. An insulating Hamiltonian is adiabatically deformed if</p>
<ul>
<li>its parameters are changed continuously,</li>
<li>the important symmetries of the system are maintained,</li>
<li>the bulk gap around <span class="math inline">\(E=0\)</span> remains open.</li>
</ul>
<p>The deformation is a fictitious process, and does not take place in time. However, if we do think of it as a process in real time, the adiabatic theorem [15] tells us, that, starting from the many-body ground state (separated from excited states by the energy gap), and performing the deformation slowly enough, we end up in the ground state, at least as far as the bulk of the system is concerned. At the edges of a system, changes can occur, and there is a subtle point to be made about adiabatic deformations being slow, but not too slow, that the edges should still be considered separately. We will come back to this point in Chap. <span class="math inline">\(4 .\)</span></p>
<h4 id="adiabatic-equivalence-of-hamiltonians">1.5.1 Adiabatic Equivalence of Hamiltonians</h4>
<p>Two insulating Hamiltonians are said to be adiabatically equivalent or adiabatically connected if there is an adiabatic deformation connecting them, that respects the important symmetries. For example, in the phase diagram Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.7\)</span> of the SSH model,</p>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="topological-invariant">1.5.2 Topological Invariant</h4>
<p>We call an integer number characterizing an insulating Hamiltonian a topological invariant, or adiabatic invariant, if it cannot change under adiabatic deformations. Note that the use of adiabatic deformations implies two properties of the topological invariant:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="1">
<li>it is only well defined in the thermodynamic limit</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="1">
<li>it depends on the symmetries that need to be respected. An example for a topological invariant is the winding number <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> of the SSH model.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>We know that two insulating Hamiltonians are not adiabatically equivalent if their topological invariants differ. Consider as an example two Hamiltonians corresponding to two points on different sides of the phase boundary in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.7\)</span> of the SSH model. They are not adiabatically connected in the phase diagram. Nevertheless, one might think that continuously modifying the bulk Hamiltonian by the addition of extra terms, while maintaining chiral symmetry, can lead to a connection between them. However, their winding numbers differ, and since winding numbers cannot change under adiabatic deformation, we know that they are not adiabatically equivalent.</p>
<h4 id="number-of-edge-states-as-a-topological-invariant">1.5.3 Number of Edge States as a Topological Invariant</h4>
<p>We have seen in Sect. 1.3.2, that the number of edge states at one end of the SSH model was an integer that did not change under a specific type of adiabatic deformation. We now generalize this example.</p>
<p>Consider energy eigenstates at the left end of a gapped chiral symmetric one dimensional Hamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., with length <span class="math inline">\(N \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, in an <strong>energy window</strong> from <span class="math inline">\(-\varepsilon&lt;E&lt;\varepsilon\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> in the bulk gap.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There can be nonzero-energy edge states in this energy window
<ul>
<li>Each nonzero-energy state has to have a chiral symmetric <strong>partner</strong>, with the state and its partner occupying the same unit cells (the chiral symmetry operator is a local unitary).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>and zero-energy edge states as well.
<ul>
<li>The number of zero-energy states is finite (because of the gap in the bulk), and they can be restricted to a single sub-lattice each. There are <span class="math inline">\(N_{A}\)</span> zero-energy states on sub-lattice <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(N_{B}\)</span> states on sub-lattice <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Consider the effect of an adiabatic deformation of the Hamiltonian, indexed by some continuous parameter <span class="math inline">\(d: 0 \rightarrow 1\)</span>, on the number <span class="math inline">\(N_{A}-N_{B} .\)</span> The Hamiltonian respects chiral symmetry, and its bulk energy gap exceeds <span class="math inline">\(2 \varepsilon\)</span>, for all values of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. The deformation can create zero-energy states by bringing a nonzero-energy edge state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Psi_{0}(d=0)\right\rangle\)</span> to zero energy, <span class="math inline">\(E_{0}(d)=0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(d \geq d^{\prime}\)</span> but not for <span class="math inline">\(d&lt;d^{\prime}\)</span>. In that case, the chiral symmetric partner of <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Psi_{0}\right\rangle\)</span>, which is <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\left|\Psi_{0}(d)\right\rangle\)</span> up to a phase factor, has to move simultaneously to zero energy. The newly created zero energy edge states are <span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}_{A}\left|\Psi_{0}\left(d^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{P}_{B}\left|\Psi_{0}\left(d^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle\)</span>, which occupy sub-lattice <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, respectively. Thus, the number <span class="math inline">\(N_{A}-N_{B}\)</span> is unchanged.</p>
<p>The deformation can also bring a zero energy state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Psi_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> to energy <span class="math inline">\(E&gt;0\)</span> at some <span class="math inline">\(d=d^{\prime}\)</span>. However, it must also create a chiral symmetric partner with energy <span class="math inline">\(E&lt;0\)</span> at the same <span class="math inline">\(d^{\prime}\)</span>. This is the time reverse of the process of the previous paragraph: here, both <span class="math inline">\(N_{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_{B}\)</span> must decrease by 1, and, again, <span class="math inline">\(N_{A}-N_{B}\)</span> is unchanged.</p>
<p>The deformation can move nonzero-energy states in or out of the <span class="math inline">\(-\varepsilon&lt;E&lt;\varepsilon\)</span> energy window. This obviously has no effect on the number <span class="math inline">\(N_{A}-N_{B}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Due to the deformation, the wavefunction of a zero-energy eigenstate can change so that it extends deeper and deeper into the bulk. However, because of the gap condition, zero-energy states have to have wavefunctions that decay exponentially towards the bulk, and so this process cannot move them away from the edge. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(N_{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_{B}\)</span> cannot be changed this way.</p>
<p>The arguments above show that <span class="math display">\[
N_{A}-N_{B}
\]</span> the net number of edge states on sublattice <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> at the left edge, is a topological invariant.</p>
<h4 id="bulk-boundary-correspondence-in-the-ssh-model">1.5.4 Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in the SSH Model</h4>
<p>We have introduced two topological invariants for the SSH model:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the winding number <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>,</li>
<li>the net number of edge states, <span class="math inline">\(N_{A}-N_{B}\)</span>,</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one was obtained from the bulk Hamiltonian only, the second by looking at the low energy sector of the left edge.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the trivial case of the SSH model, <span class="math inline">\(v&gt;w\)</span>, both are 0 ;</li>
<li>in the topological case, <span class="math inline">\(v&lt;w\)</span>, both are 1 .</li>
</ul>
<p>This shows that we can use the bulk topological invariant (the winding number) to make simple robust predictions about the low-energy physics at the edge. This is a simple example for the bulk boundary correspondence, a recurrent theme in the theory of topological insulators, which will reappear in various models in the forthcoming chapters.</p>
<h4 id="bound-states-at-domain-walls">1.5.5 Bound States at Domain Walls</h4>
<p>Edge states do not only occur at the ends of an open chain, but also at domain walls between different insulating domains of the same chain. This can be understood via the fully dimerized limit. The example in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.8\)</span></p>
<p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210528225927844.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" style="zoom:67%;" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fig. 1.8 A long, fully dimerized SSH chain with 3 domains. The boundaries between the domains. the "domain walls", host zero energy eigenstates (yellow shading). These can be localized on a single site, as for the domain wall at <span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span>, or on a superposition of sites, as the odd superposition of the ends of the trimer shared between the <span class="math inline">\(n=6\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n=7\)</span> unit cells</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hosts two types of domain walls:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>one containing a single isolated site, which hosts a zero-energy state (no onsite potentials are allowed),</li>
<li>and one containing a trimer. On a trimer, the odd superposition of the two end sites form a zero-energy eigenstate. In the example of Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1.8\)</span>, this is</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}(|6, B\rangle-|7, B\rangle)=0
\]</span> Note that, just as the edge states at the ends of the chain, these zero-energy states at the domain walls have wavefunctions that take nonzero values on one sublattice only.</p>
<p>From a perfect dimerized phase without domains it is only possible to germinate an even number of domain walls. This means that if one encounters a domain wall with a localized state on one sublattice then there will be another domain wall somewhere in the system -possibly at the system's edge-with a localized state on the opposite sublattice.</p>
<p>Consider a domain wall in an SSH system that is not in the fully dimerized limit. The wavefunctions of the edge states at the domain walls will penetrate to some small depth into the bulk, with exponentially decaying evanescent tails. For two domain walls at a distance of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> unit cells, the two edge states on the walls will hybridize, form "bonding" and "anti-bonding" states. At half filling, of these only the negative energy eigenstate will be occupied. This state hosts a single electron, however, its wavefunction is localized with equal weight on the two domain walls.</p>
<p>Hence each domain wall, when well separated from other domain walls and the ends of the chain, will carry half an electronic charge. This effect is sometimes referred to as "fractionalization" of the charge.</p>
<h4 id="exact-calculation-of-edge-states">1.5.6 Exact Calculation of Edge States</h4>
<p>The zero energy edge states of the SSH model can also be calculated exactly, even in the absence of translational invariance. Take an SSH model on <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> unit cells, with complex intracell and intercell hopping amplitudes, <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> However, we also have to fulfill boundaries , which give <span class="math display">\[
b_{1}=a_{N}=0
\]</span> These equations together say that, in the generic case, there is no zero energy eigenstate, <span class="math inline">\(a_{m}=b_{m}=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Although there is no exactly zero energy state, they admit two approximate solutions in the thermodynamic limit, <span class="math inline">\(N \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, if the average intercell hopping is stronger than the intracell hopping. More precisely, we define the "bulk average values", <span class="math display">\[
