<h2 id="chapter-6-two-dimensional-chern-insulators-the-qi-wu-zhang-model">Chapter 6 Two-Dimensional Chern Insulators: The Qi-Wu-Zhang Model</h2>
<p>The unique physical feature of topological insulators is the guaranteed existence of low-energy states at their boundaries. We have seen an example of this for a one-dimensional topological insulator, the SSH model: A finite, open, topologically nontrivial SSH chain hosts zero-energy bound states at both ends. The bulkboundary correspondence was the way in which the topological invariant of the bulk-in the case of the SSH chain, the winding number of the bulk Hamiltoniancan be used to predict the number of edge states.</p>
<p>We will show that the connection between the Chern number and the number of edge-state channels is valid in general for two-dimensional insulators. This is the statement of bulk-boundary correspondence for Chern insulators. The way we will show this inverts the argument above: taking any two-dimensional insulator, we can map it to an adiabatic pump sequence in a one-dimensional insulator by demoting one of the wavenumbers to time. The connection between the Chern number and the number of edge states in the higher dimensional Hamiltonian is a direct consequence of the connection between Chern number and charge pumping in the lower dimensional system.</p>
<p>Chern insulators (two-dimensional band insulators with nonvanishing Chern number) were first used to explain the Quantum Hall Effect. There an external magnetic field, included in lattice models via a Peierls substitution, is responsible for the nonzero value of the Chern number. Peierls substitution, however, breaks the lattice translation invariance. This necessitates extra care, including the use of magnetic Brillouin zones whose size depends on the magnetic field.</p>
<p>The models we construct in this chapter describe the so-called Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect. Here we have the same connection between edge states and bulk Chern number as in the Quantum Hall Effect, however, there is no external magnetic field, and thus no complications with magnetic Brillouin zones. The Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect has recently been observed in thin films of chromium-doped <span class="math inline">\(( Bi , Sb )_{2} Te _{3}[8] .\)</span></p>
<p>To illustrate the concepts of Chern insulators, we will use a toy model introduced by Qi, Wu and Zhang [24], which we call the QWZ model. This model is also important because it forms the basic building block of the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model for the Quantum Spin Hall Effect (Chap. 8), and thus it is also sometimes called "half BHZ".</p>
<h2 id="dimensional-extension-from-an-adiabatic-pump-to-a-chern-insulator">6.1 Dimensional Extension: From an Adiabatic Pump to a Chern Insulator</h2>
<p>We want to construct a two-dimensional lattice Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> with a nonvanishing bulk Chern number. We will do this by first constructing the bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\left(k_{x}, k_{y}\right)\)</span>, from which the real-space Hamiltonian can be obtained by Fourier transformation. For the construction we simply take an adiabatic pump sequence on a one-dimensional insulator, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}(k, t)\)</span>, and reinterpret the cyclic time variable <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as a new momentum variable <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span>. This way of gaining an extra dimension by promotion of a cyclic parameter in a continuous ensemble to a momentum is known as dimensional extension. This, and the reverse process of dimensional reduction, are key tools to construct the general classification of topological insulators [29].</p>
<h4 id="from-the-rice-mele-model-to-the-qi-wu-zhang-model">6.1.1 From the Rice-Mele Model to the Qi-Wu-Zhang Model</h4>
<p>To see how the construction of a Chern insulator works, we take the example of the smooth pump sequence on the Rice-Mele model from the previous chapter, Eq. (4.7). In addition to the promotion of time to an extra wavenumber, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega t \rightarrow k_{y}\)</span>, we also do an extra unitary rotation in the internal Hilbert space, to arrive at the Qi-Wu-Zhang model, <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}(k)=\sin k_{x} \hat{\sigma}_{x}+\sin k_{y} \hat{\sigma}_{y}+\left[u+\cos k_{x}+\cos k_{y}\right] \hat{\sigma}_{z}
\]</span> The mapping is summarized in Table <span class="math inline">\(6.1\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l|l}
\hline \text { Adiabatic pump in the RM model } &amp; \text { QWZ model (Chern insulator) } \\
\hline \text { Average intracell hopping } \bar{v} &amp; \text { Staggered onsite potential } u \\
\hline \text { Wavenumber } k \in[0,2 \pi) &amp; \text { Wavenumber } k_{x} \in[0,2 \pi) \\
\hline \text { Time } t \in[0, T) &amp; \text { Wavenumber } k_{y} \in[0,2 \pi) \\
\hline \sigma_{x}, \sigma_{y}, \sigma_{z} &amp; \sigma_{y}, \sigma_{z}, \sigma_{x} \\
\hline
\end{array}

</blockquote>
<p>The corresponding <span class="math inline">\(d ( k )\)</span> vector reads, <span class="math display">\[
d \left(k_{x}, k_{y}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\sin k_{x} \\
\sin k_{y} \\
u+\cos k_{x}+\cos k_{y}
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> #### 6.1.2 Bulk Dispersion Relation</p>
<p>We can find the dispersion relation of the QWZ model using the algebraic properties of the Pauli matrices, whereby <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}^{2}=E( k ) I _{2}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(I _{2}\)</span> the unit matrix. Thus, the spectrum of the QWZ model has two bands, the two eigenstates of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}( k )\)</span>, with energies <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
E_{\pm}\left(k_{x}, k_{y}\right) &amp;=\pm\left| d \left(k_{x}, k_{y}\right)\right| \\
&amp;=\pm \sqrt{\sin ^{2}\left(k_{x}\right)+\sin ^{2}\left(k_{y}\right)+\left(u+\cos \left(k_{x}\right)+\cos \left(k_{y}\right)\right)^{2}}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> The spectrum of the QWZ model is depicted in Fig. 6.1. There is an energy gap in the spectrum of the QWZ model, which closes at finetuned values of <span class="math inline">\(u=+2,0,-2\)</span>. This is simple to show, since the gap closing requires <span class="math inline">\(d ( k )=0\)</span> at some <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. From Eq. (6.2), <span class="math inline">\(d_{x}( k )=d_{y}( k )=0\)</span> restricts us to four inequivalent points in the Brillouin zone: - if <span class="math inline">\(u=-2\)</span> : at <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=k_{y}=0\)</span>, the so-called <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> point; - if <span class="math inline">\(u=0\)</span> : at <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=0, k_{y}=\pi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=\pi, k_{y}=0\)</span>, two inequivalent so-called <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> points; - if <span class="math inline">\(u=+2\)</span> : at <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=\pi, k_{y}=\pi\)</span>, the so-called <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> point; note that <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=\pm \pi\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}=\pm \pi\)</span> are all equivalent</p>
<p>In the vicinity of a gap closing point, called Dirac point, the dispersion relation has the shape of a Dirac cone, as seen in Fig. 6.1. For all other values of <span class="math inline">\(u \neq-2,0,2\)</span>, the spectrum is gapped, and thus it makes sense to investigate the topological properties of the system.</p>
<h4 id="chern-number-of-the-q-wz-model">6.1.3 Chern Number of the <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> WZ Model</h4>
<p>Although we calculated the Chern number of the corresponding pump sequence in the previous chapter, we show the graphical way to calculate the Chern number of the QWZ model. We simply count how many times the torus of the image of the Brillouin zone in the space of d contains the origin. To get some feeling about the not so trivial geometry of the torus, it is instructive to follow a gradual sweep of the Brillouin zone in Fig. 6.2. The parameter <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> shifts the whole torus along the <span class="math inline">\(d_{z}\)</span> direction, thus as we tune it we also control whether the origin is contained inside it or not. For the QWZ model three situations can occur as depicted in Fig. 6.3. It can happen that the torus does not contain the origin, as in (a) and (d), and the Chern number is <span class="math inline">\(Q=0 .\)</span> This is the case for <span class="math inline">\(|u|&gt;2\)</span>. It can also happen that the origin is in the inside of the torus: a line from the origin to infinity will then invevitably pierce the torus. The first piercing can be from the blue side (outside) of the surface as in (b), with <span class="math inline">\(Q=-1-\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(-2&lt;u&lt;0-\)</span> or from the red side (inside) as in (c), with <span class="math inline">\(Q=1-\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;u&lt;2\)</span></p>
<p>To summarize, the Chern number <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> of the QWZ model is <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
u&lt;-2 &amp;: &amp; Q=0 \\
-2&lt;u&lt;0 &amp;: &amp; Q &amp;=-1
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
0&lt;u&lt;2 &amp;: &amp; Q=+1 \\
2&lt;u &amp;: &amp; Q &amp;=0
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<h4 id="the-real-space-hamiltonian">6.1.4 The Real-Space Hamiltonian</h4>
<p>We obtain the full Hamiltonian of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model by inverse Fourier transform of the bulk momentum-space Hamiltonian, Eq. (6.1), as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{r}
\hat{H}=\sum_{m_{x}=1}^{N_{x}-1} \sum_{m_{y}=1}^{N_{y}}\left(\left|m_{x}+1, m_{y}\right\rangle\left\langle m_{x}, m_{y}\right| \otimes \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{z}+i \hat{\sigma}_{x}}{2}+h . c .\right) \\
\quad+\sum_{m_{x}=1}^{N_{x}} \sum_{m_{y}=1}^{N_{y}-1}\left(\left|m_{x}, m_{y}+1\right\rangle\left\langle m_{x}, m_{y}\right| \otimes \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{z}+i \hat{\sigma}_{y}}{2}+\text { h.c. }\right) \\
\quad+u \sum_{m_{x}=1}^{N_{x}} \sum_{m_{y}=1}^{N_{y}}\left|m_{x}, m_{y}\right\rangle\left\langle m_{x}, m_{y}\right| \otimes \hat{\sigma}_{z}
\end{array}
\]</span> As sketched in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(6.4\)</span>, the model describes a particle with two internal states hopping on a lattice where the nearest neighbour hopping is accompanied by an operation on the internal degree of freedom, and this operation is different for the hoppings along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> directions. In addition, there is a staggered onsite potential of strength <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> (if we envision the internal degree of freedom as representing two sites within the unit cell). Unlike in the case of the SSH model (Chap. 1), the real-space form of the QWZ Hamiltonian is not intuitive.</p>
<h2 id="edge-states">6.2 Edge States</h2>
<p>We constructed a Chern insulator using an adiabatic charge pump. As we saw in Chap. 4, charge pumps also induce energy eigenstates at the edge regions that cross from negative energy to positive energy bands, or vice versa. What do these energy eigenstates correspond to for the Chern insulator?</p>
<h4 id="dispersion-relation-of-a-strip-shows-the-edge-states">6.2.1 Dispersion Relation of a Strip Shows the Edge States</h4>
<p>To see edge states, consider a strip of a two-dimensional insulator depicted in Fig. 6.4. Along <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we take periodic boundary conditions (close the strip to a cylinder), and go to the limit <span class="math inline">\(N_{y} \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. Along <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, the strip is terminated by setting the hopping amplitudes to 0 (open boundary condition), and it consists of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> sites. Translation invariance holds along <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, so we can partially Fourier transform -only along <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. After the Fourier transformation, the original Hamiltonian falls apart to a set of one-dimensional lattice Hamiltonians indexed by a continuous parameter <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span>, the wavenumber along <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. For the QWZ model, Eq. (6.6), the <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> -dependent Hamiltonian reads <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{r}
\hat{H}\left(k_{y}\right)=\sum_{m_{x}=1}^{N_{x}-1}\left(\left|m_{x}+1\right\rangle\left\langle m_{x}\right| \otimes \frac{\hat{\sigma}_{z}+i \hat{\sigma}_{x}}{2}+\text { h.c. }\right)+ \\
\sum_{m_{x}=1}^{N_{x}}\left|m_{x}\right\rangle\left\langle m_{x}\right| \otimes\left(\cos k_{y} \hat{\sigma}_{z}+\sin k_{y} \hat{\sigma}_{y}+u \hat{\sigma}_{z}\right)
\end{array}
\]</span> Note that this is the same dimensional reduction argument as before, but for a system with edges. Energy eigenstates <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Psi\left(k_{y}\right)\right\rangle\)</span> of the strip fall into the categories of bulk states and edge states, much as in the one-dimensional case. All states are delocalized along <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, but bulk states are also delocalized along <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, while edge states are exponentially confined to the left <span class="math inline">\((x=1)\)</span> or the right <span class="math inline">\((x=N)\)</span> edge. If we find energy eigenstates with energy deep in the bulk gap, they have to be edge states, and can be assigned to the left or the right edge.</p>
<p>An example for the dispersion relation of a strip is shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(6.5\)</span>, edge states on the left/right edge highlighted using light blue/dark red. We used the QWZ model, strip width <span class="math inline">\(N=10\)</span>, sublattice potential parameter <span class="math inline">\(u=-1.5\)</span>, and the same practical definition of edge states as in the Rice-Mele model, <span class="math display">\[
\left|\Psi\left(k_{y}\right)\right\rangle \text { is on the right edge } \Leftrightarrow \sum_{m_{x}=N-1}^{N} \sum_{\alpha \in\{A, B\}}\left|\left\langle\Psi\left(k_{y}\right) \mid m_{x}, \alpha\right\rangle\right|^{2}&gt;0.6 ;
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left|\Psi\left(k_{y}\right)\right\rangle \text { is on the left edge } \Leftrightarrow \sum_{m_{x}=1}^{2} \sum_{\alpha \in\{A, B\}}\left|\left\langle\Psi\left(k_{y}\right) \mid m_{x}, \alpha\right\rangle\right|^{2}&gt;0.6 \text { . }
\]</span></p>
<h4 id="quad-edge-states-conduct-unidirectionally">6.2.2 <span class="math inline">\(\quad\)</span> Edge States Conduct Unidirectionally</h4>
<p>Notice the edge state branches of the dispersion relation of the QWZ strip, Fig. <span class="math inline">\(6.5\)</span>. which connect the lower and upper band across the bulk gap. They are the edge states of the pumped Rice-Mele model, Fig. <span class="math inline">\(4.6\)</span>, but we now look at them with a new eye. For the edge states in the QWZ model, <span class="math inline">\(d E / d k_{y}\)</span> corresponds to the group velocity along the edge. Thus, the dispersion relation tells us that particles in the QWZ model at low energy are confined either to the to left edge and propagate upwards, or to the right edge and propagate downwards.</p>
<p>The presence of one-way conducting edge state branches implies that the QWZ model is no longer, strictly speaking, an insulator. Because of the bulk energy gap, it cannot conduct (at low energies) between the left and right edges. However, it will conduct along each edge.</p>
<h4 id="edge-states-and-edge-perturbation">6.2.3 Edge States and Edge Perturbation</h4>
<p>We can use dimensional reduction and translate the discussion about the robustness of edge states from Chap. 4 to the edge states of the QWZ model. This treats the case where the Hamiltonian is modified in a way that it only acts in the edge regions, and is translation invariant along the edges. As an example, we introduce an extra, stateindependent next-nearest neighbor hopping, and onsite potentials at the left and right edge of the sample. As Fig. <span class="math inline">\(6.6\)</span> shows, this can modify the existing edge state branches, as well as create new edge state branches by deforming bulk branches. Including the new local terms the Hamiltonian of Eq. (6.7) is augmented to read <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{r}

\]</span> Here, <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{(1) /(N)}\)</span> is the onsite potential on the left/right edge and <span class="math inline">\(h_{2}^{(1) /(N)}\)</span> describes a second nearest neighbor hopping on the left/right edge. If not stated otherwise these terms are considered to be zero.</p>
<p>In the top row of Fig. <span class="math inline">\(6.6\)</span> the spectrum of strips without edge perturbations are depicted for Chern number <span class="math inline">\(Q=-1\)</span> (a) and <span class="math inline">\(Q=0\)</span> (b) respectively. As we expected, a nonzero Chern number results in edge states, one on each edge. In (c) and (d) switching on perturbations, we see new edge states moving in to the gap. The onsite potential acts as an overall shift in energy on the states around <span class="math inline">\(m_{x}=N\)</span>, the second nearest neighbor hopping adds a considerable warping to the states localized around <span class="math inline">\(m_{x}=1\)</span>. The deformations can change the number of edge states at a specific energy, but only by adding a pair of edge states with opposite propagation directions. This leaves the topological invariant unchanged.</p>
<h4 id="higher-chern-numbers-by-coupling-layers">6.2.4 Higher Chern Numbers by Coupling Layers</h4>
<p>A systematic way to construct models with higher Chern numbers is to layer sheets of Chern insulators onto each other, as illustrated in Fig. 6.7. The single-particle Hilbert space of the composite system of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> layers is a direct sum of the Hilbert spaces of the layers. <span class="math display">\[
H _{D}= H _{L 1} \oplus H _{L 2} \oplus \ldots \oplus H _{L D}
\]</span> The Hamiltonian, including a state-independent interlayer coupling with amplitude <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, is <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{D}=\sum_{d=1}^{D}|d\rangle\langle d| \otimes \hat{H}_{L d}+\sum_{d=1}^{D-1}\left(|d+1\rangle\langle d|+| d\rangle\langle d+1| \otimes C \hat{ I }_{2 N_{x} N_{y}},\right.
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\hat{I}_{2 N_{x} N_{y}}\)</span> the unit operator on the Hilbert space of a single layer. The operators <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{L d}\)</span> we consider below are of the form of Eq. (6.10) with different values of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, and can have an overall real prefactor. In layer <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> the strength of the local edge potential is denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{(1) /(N)_{d}}\)</span>. As an example, the matrix of the Hamiltonian of a system with three coupled layers reads <span class="math display">\[
H_{3}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
H_{L 1} &amp; C I &amp; 0 \\
C I &amp; H_{L 2} &amp; C I \\
0 &amp; C I &amp; H_{L 3}
\end{array}\right] .
\]</span> Numerical results for two and three coupled layers, with different Chern numbers in the layers, are shown in Fig. 6.8. The coupling of copropagating edge modes lifts</p>
<p>the degeneracies, but cannot open gaps in the spectrum, except in the case of strong coupling. This is a simple consequence of the fact that an energy eigenstate has to be a single valued function of momentum. To open a gap, counterpropagating edge states have to be coupled. We achieve this by coupling layers of the QWZ model with opposite sign of the Chern number <span class="math inline">\(Q .\)</span> For the case of two layers (Fig. <span class="math inline">\(6.8\)</span>, second row), this opens a gap in the spectrum. If there are three layers, there is a majority direction for the edge states, and so one edge state survives the coupling.</p>
<h2 id="robustness-of-edge-states">6.3 Robustness of Edge States</h2>
<p>Up to now, we have considered clean edges, i.e., two-dimensional Chern insulators that were terminated by an edge (at <span class="math inline">\(m_{x}=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_{x}=N\)</span> ), but translationally invariant along the edge, along <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. This translational invariance, and the resulting fact that the wavenumber <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> is a good quantum number, was used for the definition of the topological invariant <span class="math inline">\(N_{+}-N_{-}\)</span>, which was the net number of edge bands propagating along the edge, equal to the bulk Chern number, <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. With disorder in the edge region that breaks translational invariance along <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we no longer have a good quantum number <span class="math inline">\(k_{v}\)</span>, and edge state bands are not straightforward to define. However, as we show in this section, the edge states must still be there in the presence of disorder, since disorder at the edges cannot close the bulk gap.</p>
<h4 id="smoothly-removing-disorder">6.3.1 Smoothly Removing Disorder</h4>
<p>Consider a finite sample of a Chern insulator, with a clean bulk part but disordered edge region, as depicted in Fig. 6.9. The bulk gap of the sample decreases due to disorder, but we suppose that it is not closed completely (just renormalized). Consider now a small part of the sample, containing some of the edge, indicated by the dotted rectangle on the right of Fig. 6.9. Although this is much smaller than the whole sample, it is big enough so that part of it can be considered as translation invariant "bulk". Now in this small part of the sample, we adiabatically (and smoothly) deform the Hamiltonian in such a way that we set the disorder gradually to <span class="math inline">\(0 .\)</span> This includes straightening the part of the open boundary of the sample that falls into the dotted rectangle, to a straight line. The deformation is adiabatic in the sense that the bulk gap is not closed in the process. Since this small part is a clean Chern insulator, with a bulk Chern number of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, it can be deformed in such a way that the only edge states it contains are <span class="math inline">\(|Q|\)</span> states propagating counterclockwise (if <span class="math inline">\(Q&gt;0\)</span>, say <span class="math inline">\()\)</span></p>
<h4 id="unitarity-particles-crossing-the-clean-part-have-to-go-somewhere">6.3.2 Unitarity: Particles Crossing the Clean Part Have to Go Somewhere</h4>
<p>Consider a particle in an edge state in the small clean part of the sample, with energy deep inside the bulk gap <span class="math inline">\((E \approx 0) .\)</span> What can its future be, as its time evolution follows the Schrödinger equation appropriate for this closed system? Since the edge state is a chiral mode, the particle has to propagate along the edge until it leaves the clean region. Because of unitarity, the particle cannot "stop" at the edge: that would mean that at the "stopping point", the divergence of the particle current in the energy eigenstate is nonzero. In other words, the particle current that flows in the edge state has to flow somewhere. (Put differently, if the mode describing an edge state particle "stopped at the interface", two particles, initially orthogonal, following each other in the mode, would after some time arrive to the same final state. This would break unitarity.) After leaving the clean part of the sample, the particle cannot propagate into the bulk, since its energy is deep in the bulk gap. The disorder in the clean part was removed adiabatically, and thus there are no edge states at the interface of the clean part and the disordered part of the sample, along the dashed line. The particle cannot turn back, as there are no edge states running "down" along the edge in the clean part. The only thing the particle can do is propagate along the edge, doing a full loop around the sample until it comes back to the clean part from below again. The argument of the previous paragraph shows that even though the sample is disordered, there has to be a low energy mode that conducts perfectly (reflectionless) along the edge. Since at zero energy there are <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> orthogonal states a particle can be in at the edge of the clean part of the sample, unitarity of the dynamics of the particles requires that all along the edge of the disordered sample there are <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> orthogonal modes that conduct counterclockwise. There can be additional low energy states, representing trapped particles, or an equal number of extra edge states for particles propagating counterclockwise and clockwise. However, the total number of counterclockwise propagating edge modes at any part of the edge always has to be larger by <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> than the number of clockwise propagating edge modes. Because the Hamiltonian is short range, our conclusions regarding the number of edge states at any point far from the deformed region have to hold independent of the deformation.</p>
<p>To be precise, in the argument above we have shown the existence of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> edge states all along the edge of the sample, except for the small part that was adiabatically cleaned from disorder. One way to finish the argument is by considering another part of the sample. If we now remove the disorder adiabatically only in this part, we obtain the existence of the edge modes in parts of the sample including the original dotted rectangle, which was not covered by the argument of the previous paragraph.</p>
