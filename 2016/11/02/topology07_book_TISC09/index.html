<h2 id="chapter-9-time-reversal-invariant-topological-insulators">Chapter-9 Time-Reversal-Invariant Topological Insulators</h2>
<p>The Haldane model of a Chern insulator shows that a nontrivial insulator with nonzero Hall conductance can exist when TR symmetry is broken. More than 15 years after the Haldane model was published, it was realized that keeping symmetries intact gives rise to systems as interesting as the ones where symmetries are broken. Kane and Mele <span class="math inline">\([4,5]\)</span> first realized that by doubling the Haldane model of the Chern insulator by introducing spin in the problem, we can obtain an insulator that maintains TR symmetry but has a robust, gapless pair of helical (not chiral) edge states. In this chapter we introduce the Kane and Mele model first and then introduce the HgTe model [7] for a topological insulator. Such an insulator was the first experimentally realizable topological insulator, and its experimental discovery blew the field of topological insulators wide open.</p>
<h2 id="the-kane-and-mele-model-continuum-version">9.1 The Kane and Mele Model: Continuum Version</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we chose the same gauge choices and lattice orientation as in the original Kane and Mele papers. As such, we need to rotate the graphene lattice by <span class="math inline">\(\pi / 2\)</span> compared with the one we used for the Haldane model: <span class="math inline">\(k_{x} \rightarrow k_{y}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k_{v} \rightarrow-k_{x} .\)</span> The <span class="math inline">\(K, K^{\prime}\)</span> Haldane Hamiltonians become <span class="math display">\[
h( K + \kappa )=-3 t_{2} \cos (\phi)-\frac{3}{2} t_{1}\left(\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}+\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y}\right)+\left(M-3 \sqrt{3} t_{2} \sin (\phi)\right) \sigma_{z}
\]</span> For <span class="math inline">\(\kappa \ll K\)</span> and around <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
h\left( K ^{\prime}+ \kappa \right)=-3 t_{2} \cos (\phi)-\frac{3}{2} t_{1}\left(-\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}+\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y}\right)+\left(M+3 \sqrt{3} t_{2} \sin (\phi)\right) \sigma_{z}
\]</span> We begin with a low-energy description of graphene by expanding the wavefunction around the points <span class="math inline">\(K , K ^{\prime}\)</span>. We can mix the wavefunction around <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> in a four-component spinor: <span class="math display">\[
\Psi(r)=\left(\left(u_{A}( K ), u_{B}( K )\right),\left(u_{A}\left( K ^{\prime}\right), u_{B}\left( K ^{\prime}\right)\right)\right) \psi(r) .
\]</span> For the moment, assume no Haldane phase <span class="math inline">\((\phi=0)\)</span>, and denote the Dirac velocity <span class="math inline">\(v_{F}=-\frac{3 a t_{1}}{2}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(t_{1}&lt;0\)</span>. The low-energy description of graphene around each Dirac node is then given by the Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[
H_{0}=-i \hbar v_{f} \psi^{\dagger}\left(\sigma_{x} \tau_{z} \partial_{x}+\sigma_{y} \partial_{y}\right) \psi
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{z}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1\end{array}\right)\)</span> acts in the <span class="math inline">\(K , K ^{\prime}\)</span> -point space. In matrix notation, <span class="math display">\[
H_{0}=-i \hbar v_{F} \psi^{\dagger}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma_{x} \partial_{x}+\sigma_{y} \partial_{y} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -\sigma_{x} \partial_{x}+\sigma_{y} \partial_{y}
\end{array}\right] \psi
\]</span> where the two Hamiltonian blocks correspond to low energies around the points <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime} .\)</span> In this low-energy language, we now want to look at the possible terms that can open a gap. As we know, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span> at both <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> can open a gap that is odd under inversion. The other term, the Haldane mass, is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{z} \tau_{z} ;\)</span> it provides for a mass that changes sign between the points <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span>. The term is even under inversion (which changes both sublattices and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span>, but it is odd under <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="adding-spin">9.1.1 Adding Spin</h3>
<p>The Hamiltonian in equation(9.5) is for spinless fermions. We now want to add spin to the system, which doubles it. For each spin <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow, \downarrow\)</span>, the starting Hamiltonian is in equation <span class="math inline">\((9.5)\)</span>, and the Hamiltonian becomes an <span class="math inline">\(8 \times 8\)</span> matrix if we include all spin, points <span class="math inline">\(K , K ^{\prime}\)</span>, and sublattice <span class="math inline">\(A, B\)</span> structure in a single low-energy matrix. This is the low-energy gapless graphene Hamiltonian with spin. As per our previous analyses, we suspect something interesting can happen if we open gaps in the system. Several gaps are possible: the boring ones are just doubled versions of the gaps that we encountered in the spinless version. If the gaps do not make use of the new spin structure, we are bound to obtain just doubled versions of the Haldane model. However, with added spin, another gap-opening term is possible: <span class="math display">\[
H_{\text {so }}=\lambda_{\text {so }} \psi^{\dagger} \sigma_{z} \tau_{z} s_{z} \psi
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s_{z}\)</span> is the electron spin. The <span class="math inline">\(s_{i}\)</span> matrices act on spin space, the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{i}\)</span> act on the <span class="math inline">\(A, B\)</span> sublattice space, and the <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{i}\)</span> act on the low-energy <span class="math inline">\(K , K ^{\prime}\)</span> space. This term respects TR symmetry, as we show shortly. It is easy to prove that this is the only <span class="math inline">\(q=0\)</span> constant term allowed by mirror symmetry. Forbroken mirror symmetry <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> which can happen either by an applied electric field in the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> -direction or by the substrate <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> we can have a term of the Rashba type <span class="math inline">\([41],( s \times p ) \cdot \hat{z}\)</span> : <span class="math display">\[
H_{R}=\lambda_{R} \psi^{\dagger}\left(\sigma_{x} \tau_{z} s_{y}-\sigma_{y} s_{x}\right) \psi
\]</span> Let us now analyze the TR properties of these terms. Because we have added spin to the system, the TR operator has changed to <span class="math inline">\(T=-i s_{y} K\)</span> instead of just <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> for spinless fermions (where this <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is complex conjugation, not to be confused with the momentum <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in graphene). The Hamiltonian at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> without spin-orbit coupling can be written as <span class="math display">\[
H_{0}( K + k )=\psi^{\dagger}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
h_{\uparrow}( k ) &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; h_{\downarrow}( k )
\end{array}\right] \psi
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(h_{\uparrow}=h_{\downarrow}=k_{x} \sigma_{x}+k_{y} \sigma_{y}\)</span> are the spinless graphene Hamiltonians around <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. We now want to add a constant in terms of <span class="math inline">\(K + k\)</span> that can open a gap. To open a gap, any extra added Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H\)</span> must anticommute with <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span>. If the added term commutes with any of the matrices in the Hamiltonian, then it will not open a gap: for example, <span class="math inline">\(k_{x} \sigma_{x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a \sigma_{x}\)</span> commute <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> an <span class="math inline">\(a \sigma_{x}\)</span> -term does not open a gap but rather shifts the gapless point <span class="math inline">\(k_{x} \rightarrow k_{x}-a\)</span>. Hence, the terms allowed that would open a gap must anticommute with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{i}\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}( K +\)</span> k) <span class="math inline">\(=I_{s} \times k_{i} \sigma_{i}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(I_{s}\)</span> is the identity matrix in spin space. Hence, the only term allowed must contain <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(A, B\)</span> sublattice space: <span class="math display">\[
\Delta H( K + k )= D \sigma_{z},
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is a spin-space matrix. Of course, the simplest such term is the inversion-breaking mass <span class="math inline">\(\left(\sigma_{z}\right)\)</span> for spin <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow, \downarrow\)</span> at both <span class="math inline">\(K , K ^{\prime}:\)</span> this corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> being the identity in spin space. However, this is just two copies of the inversion symmetry-breaking mass term, one for spin up and one for spin down. It does not bring us anything exciting. This is, of course, because the term does not involve spin. The next simple term is to give the <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow, \downarrow\)</span> Dirac fermions at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> opposite masses: <span class="math display">\[
\Delta H( K + k )=s_{z} \sigma_{z}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma_{z} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -\sigma_{z}
\end{array}\right]
\]</span> We now figure out the form of the Hamiltonian at <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> such that the system is time-reversal invariant. In matrix form, the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> operator is <span class="math display">\[
T=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
0 &amp; -I \\
I &amp; 0
\end{array}\right] K
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> complex conjugation and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> the identity <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix. For the Bloch Hamiltonian to be <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> invariant, we need <span class="math display">\[
H(- k )=T H( k ) T^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
h_{\downarrow}( k )^{*} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; h_{\uparrow}( k )^{*}
\end{array}\right]
\]</span> The initial gapless Hamiltonian, <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}(k)\)</span>, defined over the whole BZ is obviously TR invariant, as amply discussed in previous chapters. Time reversal relates the low-energy Hamiltonian at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> with that at <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> by flipping the spin: <span class="math display">\[
\Delta H(- K - k )=\Delta H\left( K ^{\prime}- k \right)=-s_{z} \sigma_{z}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
-\sigma_{z} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sigma_{z}
\end{array}\right] .
\]</span> Thus, we have obtained the form of the low-energy gap-opening Hamiltonian around the points <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> that preserves <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Around <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, it is <span class="math inline">\(s_{z} \sigma_{z}\)</span>. Around <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span>, it is <span class="math inline">\(-s_{z} \sigma_{z}\)</span>. If we consider the eight-component spinor that contains both spin, lattice, and <span class="math inline">\(K , K ^{\prime}\)</span> quantum numbers, then a TRinvariant mass is indeed <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{\text {so }} s_{z} \sigma_{z} \tau_{z}\)</span>, as stated before. This term can obviously arise only from spin-orbit coupling because it couples the spin with the momentum quantum numbers. Such a term opens a gap in the spectrum: <span class="math display">\[
E_{k}=\pm \sqrt{\left(\hbar v_{f} k\right)^{2}+\lambda_{s o}^{2}}
\]</span> Fach band is doubly degenerate, due to the fact that we can write the full tight-binding model (not only the expansion around <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> ) as <span class="math display">\[
H=t_{1} \sum_{[i j\rangle} c_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{j \sigma}+i \lambda_{s o} \sum_{(i i j)} v_{i j} c_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} s_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}^{2} c_{j \sigma^{\prime}}
\]</span> which is just two copies of the Haldane model. The <span class="math inline">\(v_{i j}\)</span> 's are identical bond signs, as in the Haldane model.</p>
<h3 id="spin-up-and-down">9.1.2 Spin up and down</h3>
<p>We now delve further into the physical properties of the doubled Haldane model by first separately analyzing the physics of the model for spin <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span>. For spin <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span>, the Hamiltonians at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> are <span class="math display">\[
h( K + k )=k_{x} \sigma_{x}+k_{y} \sigma_{y}+\lambda_{\text {so }} \sigma_{z}, \quad h\left( K ^{\prime}+ k \right)=-k_{x} \sigma_{x}+k_{y} \sigma_{y}-\lambda_{\text {so }} \sigma_{z} \text { . }
\]</span> This is the <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span> limit of the Haldane model studied in chapter 8 . The Haldane mass term is . As such, in this regime, from our analysis of the Haldane model in the previous chapter, we know that the spin <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span> has a Hall conductance equal to 1 . For spin <span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span>, the Hamiltonians at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> are <span class="math display">\[
h( K + k )=k_{x} \sigma_{x}+k_{y} \sigma_{y}-\lambda_{s o} \sigma_{z}, \quad h(- K + k )=-k_{x} \sigma_{x}+k_{y} \sigma_{y}+\lambda_{s o} \sigma_{z}
\]</span> This is the <span class="math inline">\(M=0\)</span> limit of the Haldane model studied previously, but with an opposite Haldane term from the spin <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span> Hamiltonian. As such, from our analysis of the Haldane model, we know that the spin <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span> has a Hall conductance equal to <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>.</p>
<p>We have hence uncovered the physics of the Kane and Mele model. We have a quantum Hall effect for spin <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span> with Hall conductance 1 and a quantum Hall effect for spin <span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span> with Hall conductance <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. If we chose to place edges on our graphene sample then, on each edge separately, we will have a chiral (from the Hall conductance 1 ) and an antichiral (from the Hall conductance <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> ) edge mode, crossing at a time-reversal invariant degeneracy point, either <span class="math inline">\(k_{1}=0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(k_{\|}=\pi\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(k_{1}\)</span> is the momentum along the edge. As we have both chiral and antichiral modes on the same edge (i.e., states traveling in both directions in close proximity), a gap would usually open due to backscattering. However, in this case, backscattering singleparticle terms are forbidden due to TR invariance. We proved in chapter 4 that the scattering matrix elements between TR-invariant pairs are zero for an odd fermion number. This means that if we have an odd number of fermion pairs of edge modes (odd number of Kramers' doublets), we cannot open a gap by a single-particle backscattering term-no such TRinvariant terms can be written (however TR-invariant multiparticle interaction terms can be written). If we have an even number of Kramers' pairs on an edge, we can write singleparticle backscattering terms. This suggests the existence of two separate classes and, thus, a <span class="math inline">\(Z_{2}\)</span> classification of noninteracting topological insulators, which we further develop later.</p>
<h3 id="rashba-term">9.1.3 Rashba Term</h3>
<p>The Hamiltonian in equation(9.15) is just two decoupled Haldane Hamiltonians, one for spin and one for spin <span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span> with opposite Hall conductances. To couple the two Hamiltonians, we can also add a Rashba term at the point <span class="math inline">\(K ,( s \times \sigma ) \cdot \hat{1}_{z}\)</span> : <span class="math display">\[
h( K + k )=h( K )=\sigma_{x} s_{y}-\sigma_{y} s_{x}
\]</span> By TR invariance, we obtain the Hamiltonian at the point <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}=- K\)</span> : <span class="math display">\[
h\left( K ^{\prime}\right)=s_{y} h^{*}( K ) s_{y}=-\sigma_{x} s_{y}^{3}+\sigma_{y} s_{y} s_{x} s_{y}=-\sigma_{x} s_{y}-\sigma_{y} s_{z}
\]</span> The Hamiltonians at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> can be written in compact form for both points <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> : <span class="math display">\[
H_{R}=\sigma_{x} \tau_{2} s_{y}-\sigma_{y} s_{x}
\]</span> The Rashba term by itself(without the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> so term) does not open a full gap in the spectrum. This is due to the fact that this term does not anticommute with the Hamiltonian. At the point <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, we can add <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{R}\left(s_{y} \sigma_{x}-s_{x} \sigma_{y}\right)\)</span> to the <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}( K + k )\)</span> Hamiltonian and get the four eigenvalues <span class="math display">\[
-\lambda_{R} \pm \sqrt{k^{2}+\lambda_{R}^{2}}, \quad \lambda_{R} \pm \sqrt{k^{2}+\lambda_{R}^{2}}
\]</span> This shows that the Hamiltonian is gapless at the point <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> regardless of the value of the Rashba coupling. Out of four bands (two from the sublattice and two from spin), two are fully gapped and two are gapless. Even though it does not open a full gap by itself, the Rashba term can be used to influence (reduce or enhance) the Kane and Mele gap <span class="math inline">\(\left(\sigma_{z} s_{z} \tau_{z}\right)\)</span> because that gap term anticommutes with the Rashba term.</p>
<h2 id="the-kane-and-mele-model-lattice-version">9.2 The Kane and Mele Model: Lattice Version</h2>
<p>For completeness, we now provide the form of the Kane and Mele model over the whole hexagonal lattice <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span> and not only the continuum version around the points <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> As previously mentioned, we rotate the graphene lattice we used in the chapter 8 to keep consistency with the Kane and Mele model. We have the lattice vectors <span class="math inline">\(\delta _{3}=a(0,-1), \delta _{1}=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(a(-\sqrt{3} / 2,1 / 2), \delta _{2}=a(\sqrt{3} / 2,1 / 2)\)</span>, and the lattice translation vectors $a <em>{1}= </em>{1}- _{3}, $<span class="math inline">\(a _{2}= \delta _{2}- \delta _{3}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The primitive BZ wavevectors are <span class="math inline">\(b _{1}=\frac{2 \pi}{3 \pi}[-\sqrt{3}, 1], b _{2}=\frac{2 \pi}{3 \pi}[\sqrt{3}, 1]\)</span>, and the corners of the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span> (graphene gapless points) are <span class="math inline">\(K =\frac{2 \pi}{3}(-1 / \sqrt{3}, 1)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}=\frac{2 \pi}{3}(1 / \sqrt{3}, 1)\)</span>. We measure lengths in units of the minimum distance between two <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> sites (or two <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> sites): <span class="math inline">\(l=2 a \sin (\pi / 3)=\sqrt{3} a\)</span>. The lattice Kane and Mele Hamiltonian whose continuum form we explored in section <span class="math inline">\(9.1 .2\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
H=t \sum_{(i i)} c_{i}^{\dagger} c_{j}+i \lambda_{\text {so }} \sum_{\langle i i j\rangle} v_{i j} c_{i}^{\dagger} s_{2} c_{j}+i \lambda_{R} \sum_{(i j)} c_{i}^{\dagger}\left( s \times d _{i j}\right)_{z} c_{j}+\lambda_{v} \sum_{i} \epsilon_{i} c_{i}^{\dagger} c_{i}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c_{i}=\left(c_{i \uparrow}, c_{i \downarrow}\right)\)</span> and <span class="math display">\[
v_{i j}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\left( d _{1} \times d _{2}\right)_{z}
\]</span> are the Haldane phases. The <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> so term does not violate mirror symmetry with respect to the lattice plane: if <span class="math inline">\(z \rightarrow-z\)</span>, then the <span class="math inline">\(v_{i j}\)</span> changes sign, but so does the spin <span class="math inline">\(s_{z}\)</span> to keep the Hamiltonian unchanged. On the other hand, the Rashba term explicitly violates mirror symmetry. The <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{v}\)</span> term is the inversion-symmetry-breaking term- <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{i}=\pm 1\)</span> -depending on whether <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> site. To maintain consistency with the notation in the the original Kane and Mele paper, we define the following momentum notation: <span class="math display">\[
k \cdot a _{1}=y-x, \quad k \cdot a _{2}=y+x
\]</span> We now label our momenta in terms of <span class="math inline">\(x, y\)</span>. Because we now have two sites per unit cell and two spins, the Bloch Hamiltonian can be most conveniently written in terms of the <span class="math inline">\(S U(4)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> matrices. We introduce several of these matrices: <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{1}=\sigma^{x} \times I, \Gamma_{2}=\sigma_{z} \times I\)</span>, and, hence, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{12}=\frac{1}{2 i}\left[\Gamma_{1}, \Gamma_{2}\right]=-\sigma_{y} \times I\)</span>. In momentum space, we diagonalize the nearest-neighbor hopping of the preceding Hamiltonian and keep the Bloch part (which acts on the spinor <span class="math inline">\(\left.\psi=\left(\psi_{A \uparrow} \psi_{B \uparrow} \psi_{A \downarrow} \psi_{B \downarrow}\right)\right)\)</span> to obtain <span class="math display">\[
t \sum_{(i j)=} c_{i}^{\dagger} c_{j} \rightarrow t(1+\cos (y-x)+\cos (y+x)) \Gamma_{1}-2 t \cos (x) \cos (y) \Gamma_{12}
\]</span> The inversion-symmetry-breaking sublattice mass term is, in the Kane and Mele notation, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{v} \sum_{i} c_{i}^{\dagger} c_{i} \rightarrow \Gamma_{2}\)</span>. For the spin-orbit coupling term, we have, based on the signs in the Haldane model (but rotated by <span class="math inline">\(\pi / 2\)</span> for our configuration), <span class="math display">\[
i \lambda_{s o} \sum_{\langle(i i)} v_{i j} c_{i}^{\dagger} s^{z} c_{j} \rightarrow 2 \lambda_{s o}-(2 \sin (2 x)-4 \sin (x) \cos (y)) \Gamma_{15}
\]</span> where we have defined <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{5}=\sigma_{y} s_{z} ;\)</span> hence, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{15}=\sigma_{z} s_{z}\)</span>. This differs from the equivalent term in the original Kane and Mele paper by an overall minus sign. Up to now the Hamiltonian is <span class="math display">\[
h( k )=d_{1}( k ) \Gamma_{1}+d_{12}( k ) \Gamma_{12}+d_{2}( k ) \Gamma_{2}+d_{15}( k ) \Gamma_{15},
\]</span> where the terms <span class="math inline">\(d_{1}( k ), d_{12}( k ), d_{2}( k )\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(d_{15}( k )\)</span> can be read from equations <span class="math inline">\((9.25)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((9.26)\)</span>. We will come back and explain the purpose and choice of the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> matrices in a little while. As it stands, the Hamiltonian still has one symmetry, the mirror symmetry under reflection around the <span class="math inline">\(x y\)</span> -plane, <span class="math inline">\(z \rightarrow-z\)</span>. Under this symmetry, <span class="math inline">\(s_{z} \rightarrow-s_{z}\)</span> and also <span class="math inline">\(v_{i j} \rightarrow-v_{i j}\)</span> because the term is the z-component of a cross product. Tobreak this symmetry, we must add a term with a defined <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> -direction, the easiest of which is a Rashba-type term that corresponds to the application of an electric field in the plane: <span class="math display">\[
i \lambda_{R} \sum_{\langle i j\rangle} c_{i}^{\dagger}\left( s \times d _{i j}\right)_{2} c_{j}=i \lambda_{R} \sum_{\langle i j} c_{i}^{\dagger} \epsilon_{z m n} s^{m} d_{i j}^{n} c_{j},
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d _{i j}\)</span> is the distance between nearest-neighbor sites <span class="math inline">\(i, j\)</span>. Due to its intricate form (it couples all <span class="math inline">\(s_{x}, s_{y}\)</span> components of spin), this term is actually the most tedious to write explicitly. We find it has the following form: <span class="math display">\[
h_{R}( k )=d_{3}( k ) \Gamma_{3}+d_{4}( k ) \Gamma_{4}+d_{23}( k ) \Gamma_{23}+d_{24}( k ) \Gamma_{24},
\]</span> where the tight-binding expressions have the form <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{ll}
d_{3}( k )=\lambda_{R}(1-\cos (x) \cos (y)), &amp; d_{4}( k )=-\sqrt{3} \lambda_{R} \sin (x) \sin (y), \\
d_{23}( k )=-\lambda_{R} \cos (x) \sin (y), &amp; d_{24}( k )=\sqrt{3} \lambda_{R} \sin (x) \sin (y) .
\end{array}
\]</span> It is now time to talk in more detail about the matrices used in defining the Hamiltonian. These types of matrices will be used extensively in the future because as the minimal models of 2-D and 3-D <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -invariant topological insulators are four-band models. The Hamiltonian is a <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> Hermitian matrix (sublattice and spin), so it will be the sum of an identity matrix and the 15 matrix generators of the <span class="math inline">\(S U(4)\)</span> group. These matrices can be classified in the usual way: <span class="math inline">\(15=5+10\)</span>, where we have 5 generators of a Clifford algebra (also sometimes referred to as Dirac algebra): <span class="math display">\[
\left\{\Gamma_{a}, \Gamma_{b}\right\}=2 \delta_{a b}, \quad a, b=1,2,3,4,5 ;
\]</span> the 10 remaining generators are <span class="math display">\[
\Gamma_{a b}=\frac{1}{2 i}\left[\Gamma_{a}, \Gamma_{b}\right]
\]</span> We have already chosen several of these matrices, so let us complete the full basis: <span class="math display">\[
\Gamma_{1,2,3,4,5}=\left(\sigma_{x} I, \sigma_{z} I, \sigma_{y} s_{x}, \sigma_{y} s_{y}, \sigma_{y} s_{z}\right)
\]</span> The <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{a b}\)</span> can be easily obtained by commuting the Clifford generators but will not be written here. equation (9.34) is but one of the representations of the Clifford algebra. We will use another representation soon in connection to the HgTe model for a quantum-spin Hall state, but the general theory of the algebra is the same. The Clifford matrices chosen by Kane and Mele are invariant under time reversal <span class="math inline">\(T \Gamma_{i} T^{-1}=\Gamma_{i}\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(\left.T=i\left(I \otimes s_{y}\right) K\right)\)</span>, although other representations where this is not true are possible. A generic <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> Hamiltonian (without any specific symmetries) has the form <span class="math display">\[
h( k )=\sum_{a=1}^{5} d_{a}( k ) \Gamma_{a}+\sum_{a&lt;b=1}^{5} d_{a b}( k ) \Gamma_{a b} .
\]</span> The <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> invariance of the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{a}\)</span> implies the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> oddness of the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{a b}\)</span> 's: <span class="math inline">\(T \frac{1}{2 l}\left[\Gamma_{a}, \Gamma_{b}\right] T^{-1}=-\frac{1}{2}\left[\Gamma_{a}, \Gamma_{b}\right]\)</span>. From these properties of the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{a}, \Gamma_{a b}\)</span> matrices, a TR Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Th}( k ) T^{-1}=h(- k )\)</span> must have the following properties: <span class="math display">\[
d_{a}(- k )=d_{a}( k ), \quad d_{a b}(- k )=-d_{a b}( k ) .
\]</span> Although the matrices used in the Kane and Mele paper <span class="math inline">\([32,33]\)</span> are representation dependent and will be changed in future chapters, the representation-independent statement is that out of the <span class="math inline">\(15 SU (4)\)</span> generator matrices of a four-band Hamiltonian that includes spin, we can generically chose only 5 of them to be TR even, whereas the rest have to be TR odd.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{R}=0\)</span>, we saw this model is easy to diagonalize and gives two copies of the Haldane model and a pair of counter-propagating edge modes on each edge if diagonalized in a cylinder geometry that has open-boundary conditions on two edges. The gap is of order <span class="math inline">\(\left|6 \sqrt{3} \lambda_{\text {so }}-2 \lambda_{v}\right|\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{v}&gt;3 \sqrt{3} \lambda_{\text {so }}\)</span>, the system is an inversion-symmetry-breaking dominated phase and, if diagonalized so that the edge is of zig-zag type(see chap. 7), it will have edge modes connecting the cones (similar to the ones studied in the gapless graphene case of the previous chapters, but in this case they will be dispersive), but they will not cross the bulk gap (see fig. 9.1(b)). In contrast, for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{v}&lt;2 \sqrt{3} \lambda_{\text {so }}\)</span>, we see that the system has edge modes crossing the bulk gap, which were easily understood from the continuum argument previously given. With <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{R}=0\)</span>, this model has <span class="math inline">\(S_{z}\)</span> conservation and we can easily (as we have) talk about spinand spin <span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span> sectors. The symmetry then is <span class="math inline">\(U(1) \times U(1)\)</span>, one <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> being the charge <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> and the other being the <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(S_{z}\)</span> conservation. With <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{R} \neq 0\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(S_{z}\)</span> symmetry is broken, and we can no longer talk about two copies of fermions, one with spin <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span> and one with spin <span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span>, having separate Chern numbers. However, with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{R} \neq 0\)</span> but small so that we do not close the bulk gap, we observe that the edge modes do not disappear. When diagonalized in a cylindrical geometry (open boundary conditions in one direction, closed in the other), we find that edge modes traverse the bulk energy gap as long as <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{R}\)</span> has not closed the bulk gap.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Each edge has a pair of counterpropagating edge modes, which cross at some <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -invariant point. This crossing is protected by <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> symmetry. As long as time reversal is preserved, every k-point in the system must have a <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> orthogonal counterpart at <span class="math inline">\(- k\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -invariant points must each have two states, by Kramers' theorem. That means the gap can never open for a single pair of counterpropagating modes. For every edge in the system, we will observe a pair of edge modes. The dispersions of different edges can cross at some non- <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -invariant point, as in fig. <span class="math inline">\(9.1\)</span> (a), but the matrix elements coupling these points are zero because they have to fully traverse the system length. Hence there is no one-body, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -invariant local perturbation term that can couple the two branches of a single pair of edge modes. The situation could not be more different for an even number of a pair of edge modes on the same edge. In this case, the modes can open gaps at the intersection points between the twopairs (which can be away from a <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -invariant <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span> point). <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> does not protect that gap opening because a gap opening at <span class="math inline">\(k \neq 0\)</span> can be accompanied by another gap opening at <span class="math inline">\(-k \neq 0\)</span>, which can cancel the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> breaking of the first. Different pairs of the two modes scatter between themselves and can open a gap because the matrix elements are on the same edge.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(S_{z}\)</span> is a good quantum number, threading a flux through the system takes one spin from the left edge, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, to the right edge, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and takes spin <span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span> from edge <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to edge <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Hence the system pumps quantized spin and has a quantized spin-Hall conductance of 2 (in units of <span class="math inline">\(\left.e^{2} / h\right)\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(S_{z}\)</span> is not a good quantum number, the system does not have quantized spinHall conductance, but spin still gets pumped. We will see in chapter 10 that the system has a quantized TR polarization.</p>
<h2 id="first-topological-insulator-mercury-telluride-quantum-wells">9.3 First Topological Insulator: Mercury Telluride Quantum Wells</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the initial proposal [4] of a topological insulator in graphene was shown to be experimentally hard to achieve <span class="math inline">\([42,43]\)</span> : the gap openedby the spin-orbit interaction turns out to be extremely small, of the order of <span class="math inline">\(10^{-3}\)</span> meV. From theoretical investigations of the typeIII HgTe semiconductor quantum wells, it was then shown [7] that the topological insulating state should be realized in the "inverted" regime, where the quantum-well thickness <span class="math inline">\(d_{Q W}\)</span> is greater than a certain critical thickness <span class="math inline">\(d_{c}\)</span>. The mechanism by which the topological insulator comes about, band inversion, was later shown to be generic [9]. Most topological insulators discovered today come about through band inversion.</p>
<h3 id="inverted-quantum-wells">9.3.1 Inverted Quantum Wells</h3>
<p>We first try to give a general overview of the band structure for inverted quantum wells. The form of the Hamiltonian from which we will show the existence of a topological insulator in these quantum wells can be determined from symmetry requirements only, at least when expanded close to the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> -point <span class="math inline">\(( k =0)\)</span>. The central feature of the type-III quantum wells is band inversion: the barrier material such as cadmium telluride (CdTe) has a normal semiconductor bandprogression (similar to, say, gallium arsenide (GaAs)), with the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{6} s\)</span> -type band lying above the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{8} p\)</span> -type band and the well material HgTe having an inverted band progression whereby the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> -type <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{6}\)</span> band lies below the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> -type <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{8}\)</span> band. The <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{8}\)</span> band is an angular momentum <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{2}\)</span> band (made out of the angular momentum 1 of the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> -orbitals and electron spin <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, which are coupled by spin-orbit coupling), and its projections on the <span class="math inline">\(S_{z}\)</span> quantum number are <span class="math inline">\(\pm \frac{1}{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pm \frac{3}{2} .\)</span> The <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{6}\)</span> band is a spin- <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> band. In both these materials, the gap is the smallest near the -point in the BZ (fig.9.2). Therefore, we shall restrict ourselves to a six-band model and start with the following six basic atomic states per unit cell combined into a six-component spinor: <span class="math display">\[
\Psi=\left(\left|\Gamma_{6}, \frac{1}{2}\right\rangle,\left|\Gamma_{6},-\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle,\left|\Gamma_{8}, \frac{3}{2}\right\rangle,\left|\Gamma_{8}, \frac{1}{2}\right\rangle,\left|\Gamma_{8},-\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle\left|\Gamma_{8},-\frac{3}{2}\right\rangle\right)
\]</span> This would be the band labeling in a three-dimensional material. In quantum wells grown in the [001] direction, the cubic, or spherical symmetry, is broken down to the axial rotation symmetry in the plane. These six bands combine to form the spin <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span> and spin- <span class="math inline">\(\downarrow(\pm)\)</span> states of three quantum well subbands that have been labeled <span class="math inline">\(E 1, H 1, L 1\)</span> in the literature <span class="math inline">\([44]\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(L 1\)</span> subband is separated from the other two [44], and we neglect it, leaving an effective four-band model for thin quantum wells. At the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> -point with in-plane momentum <span class="math inline">\(k_{1}=0, m_{J}\)</span> is still a good quantum number. At this point the <span class="math inline">\(\left|E 1, m_{j}\right\rangle\)</span> quantum-well subband state is formed from the linear combination of the <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Gamma_{6}, m_{J}=\pm \frac{1}{2}\right\rangle\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Gamma_{8}, m_{I}=\pm \frac{1}{2}\right\rangle\)</span> states, whereas the <span class="math inline">\(\left|H 1, m_{I}\right\rangle\)</span> quantum-well subband state is formed from the <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Gamma_{8}, m_{j}=\pm \frac{3}{2}\right\rangle\)</span> states. Away from the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> -point, the <span class="math inline">\(E 1\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(H 1\)</span> states can mix. Because the <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Gamma_{6}, m_{J}=\pm \frac{1}{2}\right\rangle\)</span> state has opposite parity from the <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Gamma_{8}, m_{I}=\pm \frac{3}{2}\right\rangle\)</span> state under 2 -D spatial reflection, the coupling matrix element between these two states must be an odd function of the in-plane momentum <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. This is also true by considering the fact that the coupling between an <span class="math inline">\(m_{J}=\frac{3}{2}\)</span> state and an <span class="math inline">\(m_{J}=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> state has to be an <span class="math inline">\(\Delta L_{z}=1\)</span> coupling. The inplane momentum <span class="math inline">\(k_{+}=k_{x}+i k_{y}\)</span> provides that coupling. From these symmetry considerations, we deduce the general form of the effective Hamiltonian for the <span class="math inline">\(E 1\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(H 1\)</span> states, expressed in the basis of <span class="math inline">\(\left|E 1, m_{I}=\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle,\left|H 1, m_{I}=\frac{3}{2}\right\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left|E 1, m_{I}=-\frac{1}{2}\right\rangle,\left|H 1, m_{I}=-\frac{3}{2}\right\rangle\)</span> : <span class="math display">\[
H_{\text {eff }}\left(k_{x}, k_{y}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
H( k ) &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; H^{*}(- k )
\end{array}\right), \quad H( k )=\epsilon( k )+d_{i}( k ) \sigma_{i}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{i}\)</span> are the Pauli matrices. The form of <span class="math inline">\(H^{*}(- k )\)</span> in the lower block is determined from TR symmetry (as we will see in chap. 12) and <span class="math inline">\(H^{*}(- k )\)</span> is unitarily equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(H^{*}( k )\)</span> for this system. If inversion symmetry and axial symmetry around the growth axis are not broken, then the interblock matrix elements vanish, as presented. In real HgTe, however, inversion symmetry is softly broken, and off-diagonal terms are present. However, because they are small and do not close the bandgap, we can analyze the physics in the absence of these terms and argue by adiabatic continuity that the same topological physics remains valid when the inversion breaking-terms are added.</p>
<p>We see that, to the lowest order in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the Hamiltonian matrix decomposes into <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> blocks, for each spin <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow, \downarrow .\)</span> The preceding Hamiltonian has more symmetry than only inversion symmetry <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> in fact it has <span class="math inline">\(U(1) \times U(1)\)</span> symmetry, which are the two quantum Hall effects in the two spins separately. From the symmetry arguments given before, we deduce that <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}( k )\)</span> is an even function of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, whereas <span class="math inline">\(d_{1}( k )\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_{2}( k )\)</span> are odd functions of <span class="math inline">\(k-\)</span> they are <span class="math inline">\(L_{z}=1\)</span> terms. Therefore, we can generally expand them in the following form: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{c}
d_{1}+i d_{2}=A\left(k_{x}+i k_{y}\right) \equiv A k_{+} \\
d_{3}=M-B\left(k_{x}^{2}+k_{y}^{2}\right), \quad \epsilon_{k}=C-D\left(k_{x}^{2}+k_{y}^{2}\right)

<p>The Hamiltonian in the <span class="math inline">\((2 \times 2)\)</span> subspace therefore takes the form of the <span class="math inline">\((2+1)\)</span> D Dirac Hamiltonian, plus an <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon(k)\)</span> term, which drops out in the quantum Hall response. We discard this term from now on. Within each <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> subblock, the Hamiltonian has the Hall conductance <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{x y}=-\frac{1}{8 \pi^{2}} \iint d k_{x} d k_{y} \hat{ d } \cdot\left(\partial_{ x } \hat{ d } \times \partial_{y} \hat{ d },\right)
\]</span> in units of <span class="math inline">\(e^{2} / h\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{ d }\)</span> denotes the unit <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{i}(k)\)</span> vector introduced in the Hamiltonian (eq (9.37)). Although we are in the continuum, the Dirac Hamiltonian is regularized properly by the presence of the <span class="math inline">\(k^{2}\)</span> terms in the <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}( k )\)</span> term. However, if the <span class="math inline">\(k^{2}\)</span> terms were not present, the Dirac Hamiltonian would have Hall conductance <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\operatorname{sig}(M)}{2} .\)</span> The presence of the quadratic terms renders the Hall conductance an integer that is based on whether or not the vector <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{3}\)</span> winds from <span class="math inline">\(k =0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(k =\infty\)</span> from the north to the south pole of the <span class="math inline">\(S^{2}\)</span> sphere. If <span class="math inline">\(M / B&gt;0\)</span>, then it is clear that <span class="math inline">\(d_{3}\)</span> points to one pole at <span class="math inline">\(k =0\)</span> and to another at <span class="math inline">\(k =\infty\)</span>. This is the continuum regularization of a Dirac Hamiltonian and will be, for example, used in the <span class="math inline">\(p+i p\)</span> model of a topological superconductor in chapter <span class="math inline">\(16 .\)</span> The most important quantity in the Hamiltonian is the mass, or gap parameter, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, which is the energy difference between the <span class="math inline">\(E 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H 1\)</span> levels at the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> -point. The overall constant <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> sets the zero of energy to be the top of the valence band of bulk HgTe. In a quantum-well geometry, the band inversion in HgTe necessarily leads to a level crossing at some critical thickness <span class="math inline">\(d_{c}\)</span> of the HgTe layer. For thickness <span class="math inline">\(d&lt;d_{c}\)</span>, i.e., for a thin HgTe layer, the quantum well is in the "normal" regime, where the CdTe is predominant; hence, the band energies at the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> -point satisfy <span class="math inline">\(E\left(\Gamma_{6}\right)&gt;E\left(\Gamma_{8}\right)\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(d&gt;d_{c}\)</span> the HgTe layer is thick and the well is in the inverted regime where HgTe dominates and <span class="math inline">\(E\left(\Gamma_{6}\right)&lt;E\left(\Gamma_{8}\right) .\)</span> As we vary the thickness of the well, the <span class="math inline">\(E 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H 1\)</span> bands must, therefore, cross at some <span class="math inline">\(d_{c}\)</span>, and the gap parameter <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> changes sign between the two sides of the transition (fig. <span class="math inline">\(9.3\)</span> ). The form of the effective Dirac Hamiltonian and the sign change of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(d=d_{c}\)</span> for the HgTe/CdTe quantum wells deduced previously from general arguments is sufficient to conclude the existence of the quantum-spin Hall (QSH) state in this system. As we change the quantum-well thickness <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> across <span class="math inline">\(d_{c}, M\)</span> changes sign, and the gap closes at the <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> point leading to a vanishing <span class="math inline">\(d_{i}( k =0)\)</span> vector at the transition point <span class="math inline">\(d=d_{c}\)</span>. The sign change of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> leads to a well-defined change of the Hall conductance <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \sigma_{x y}=1\)</span> across the transition. So far, we have discussed only one <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> block of the effective Hamiltonian, <span class="math inline">\(H .\)</span> General TR symmetry dictates that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y}(H)=-\sigma_{x y}\left(H^{*}\right) ;\)</span> therefore, the total charge Hall conductance vanishes, whereas the spin Hall conductance, given by the difference between the two blocks, is finite and is given by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \sigma_{x y}^{(s)}=2\)</span> (in units of <span class="math inline">\(\left.e^{2} / h\right)\)</span>. From the general relationship between the quantized Hall conductance and the number of edge states, we conclude that the two sides of the phase transition at <span class="math inline">\(d=d_{c}\)</span> must differ in the number of pairs of helical edge states by 1 . Thus, one side of the transition must be <span class="math inline">\(Z_{2}\)</span> odd and topologically distinct from a fully gapped conventional insulator. To find out which side must be topologically nontrivial, we have to compute the value of <span class="math inline">\(M / B\)</span>, but the overwhelming evidence points to the inverted side being topologically nontrivial. Indeed, in the inverted gap regime where <span class="math inline">\(\frac{M}{2 B}=2.02 \times 10^{-4}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(7.0 nm\)</span> and not in the normal regime (where <span class="math inline">\(\frac{M}{2 B}&lt;0\)</span> ), and the inverted case is the topologically nontrivial regime supporting a QSH state. Figure <span class="math inline">\(9.3\)</span> shows the energies of both the <span class="math inline">\(E 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H 1\)</span> bands at <span class="math inline">\(k_{\|}=0\)</span> as a function of quantum-well thickness <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> obtained from our analytical solutions. At <span class="math inline">\(d=d_{c} \sim 6.4 nm\)</span>, these bands cross.</p>

<h2 id="experimental-detection-of-the-quantum-spin-hall-state">9.4 Experimental Detection of the Quantum Spin Hall State</h2>
<p>We now discuss the experimental detection of the QSH state. We want to focus only on purely electrical measurements because spin measurements are difficult to achieve. By sweeping the gate voltage, we can measure the two-terminal conductance <span class="math inline">\(G_{L R}\)</span> from the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> -doped to bulkinsulating to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -doped regime(figs. <span class="math inline">\(9.4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(9.5\)</span> ). In the bulk-insulating regime, <span class="math inline">\(G_{L R}\)</span> vanishes at low temperatures for a normal insulator at <span class="math inline">\(d&lt;d_{c}\)</span>, whereas <span class="math inline">\(G_{L R}\)</span> approaches a value close to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2 e^{2}}{h}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(d&gt;d_{c}\)</span> and for samples shorter than the mean free inelastic scattering path. This has been observed in a remarkable experiment performed at the University of Wurzburg [8].</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Strikingly, in a six-terminal measurement, the QSH state would exhibit vanishing electric voltage drop between the terminals <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{2}\)</span> and between <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{3}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{4}\)</span> in the zero-temperature limit and in the presence of a finite electric current between the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> terminals. In other words, longitudinal resistance should vanish in the zero-temperature limit with a powerlaw dependence, over distances larger than the mean free path. Because of the absence of backscattering, in the absence of leads along the path between source and drain, the helical edge currents flow without dissipation, and the voltage drop occurs only at the drain side of the contact [45]. Finally, a spin filtered measurement can be used to determine the spin Hall conductance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x x}^{(s)}\)</span>, although we expect this to be much more experimentally challenging. Numerical calculations [46] show that it should take a value close to <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y}^{(s)}=2\left(e^{2} / h\right)\)</span>. This experiment has not yet been performed.</p>
