<h2 id="chapter-6-square-lattice">Chapter-6 square lattice</h2>
<p>We have so far computed the Hall conductance of lattice electrons in a magnetic field. The system was an insulator (we were always able to place the Fermi level in the gap), and we used periodic boundary conditions in real space. We obtained a nonzero Hall conductance, indicating transport, even though the system has a gap. How can this be possible? The answer lies in the presence of edge states. Even though the system is a bulk insulator, when edges are made in the system (such as by the application of contacts, which are needed in order to measure anything), there will be gapless edge modes traversing the bulk gap: the system is a bulk insulator but an edge Fermi liquid. In this chapter, we show that the presence of edges is an unescapable conclusion of multiple factors: one of them, as described later, is that the system transports electrons from one edge to another during a flux insertion-and there must be a band of states on each edge ready to receive/donate such electrons. We also present a direct calculation of the spectrum with open boundary conditions (which means we have edges) based on a transfer matrix formalism due to Hatsugai [38]. Gapless edge states, as it turns out, are a fundamental aspect of many topological insulators; indeed, the triviality or nontriviality of such an insulator usually depends on the presence or absence of edge states.</p>
<p>However, the conclusion that gapless edge states must exist can be reached by the following simple argument: put two insulators, each with different values of the Hall conductance, close to each other, so that they share a boundary (which in <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> dimensions is a <span class="math inline">\((D-1)- D\)</span> space). Away from the boundary, the two insulators extend to <span class="math inline">\(\pm \infty\)</span>, respectively. The boundary between insulators preserves <span class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> charge symmetry, which is the symmetry necessary to define a Hall conductance (all our Hamiltonians so far contained only <span class="math inline">\(c^{\dagger} c\)</span> terms; no <span class="math inline">\(c^{\dagger} c^{\dagger}\)</span> superconducting terms were present). Because we know that the Hall conductance is an integer that characterizes the phase of the system, and because we know that the Hall conductance cannot be changed unless the bulk gap collapses and reopens again, the conclusion is that the boundary region that connects two insulators with different Hall conductances must have a gap-closing-and-reopening point somewhere on it-i.e., it must have an edge mode crossing the Fermi level. Otherwise, the whole space would be gapped, which by default would mean that the Hall conductance in the whole space would be the same. This type of an argument applies to a boundary between any two topologically different insulators, as long as the boundary respects the symmetry that protects the bulk-insulating state.</p>
<h2 id="laughlins-gauge-argument">Laughlin's Gauge Argument</h2>
<p>The original argument for the presence of edge states in the quantum Hall effect is due to Robert Laughlin in the early 1980s. In a seminal paper, Laughlin argued that the presence of edge modes is an inescapable consequence of transverse quantized transport in an insulator. This is even more remarkable because at that time it was widely accepted that delocalized states cannot exist in two dimensions, whereas Laughlin's argument saysthat delocalized states must exist. Of course, in retrospect, we now know that systems with nonzero Hall conductance have delocalized bulk states that carry the Chern number. These bulk states, which can be deep in the valence band, rise up in energy close to an edge due to the edge-confining potential and become the gapless edge modes. In the following, we present a modern-day version of the Laughlin gauge argument.</p>
<p>We consider a two-dimensional material (quantum well) with a magnetic field perpendicular to it. We also consider periodic boundary conditions in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -direction but place edges on the sample in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> -direction. Because the boundary conditions are periodic in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -direction, we can devise a thought experiment in which we "wrap" the sample in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -direction into a cylinder, with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> being parallel to the axis of the cylinder. Along the cylinder, <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> is a good quantum number. Through the cylinder, parallel to the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> -axis, insert a flux, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>. This flux is different from the flux generated by the magnetic field, which is "radial" to the cylinder. The flux, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>, is used to "control and change" the <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> momentum: the flux enters the Hamiltonian as <span class="math inline">\(k_{y} \rightarrow k_{y}+2 \pi \frac{\Phi}{L_{v}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(L_{y}\)</span> is the circumference of the cylinder. At the two edges of our cylindrical sample, we attach leads and put a voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_{x}\)</span> perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> between the leads: this, of course, is equivalent to creating a potential difference between the two edges. We wish to relate the current carried around the cylinder, <span class="math inline">\(j_{y}\)</span>, to the potential drop from one edge to the other. This is the Hall effect. The current operator can now be related to the change of the Hamiltonian as a function of the flux thread through the cylinder: <span class="math display">\[
j_{y}=\frac{\partial H}{\partial k_{y}}=\frac{L_{y}}{2 \pi} \frac{\partial H}{\partial \Phi}
\]</span> We take the expectation value of this current in the instantaneous ground state of the system: <span class="math display">\[
\left\langle\psi\left|j_{y}\right| \psi\right\rangle=\frac{\partial\langle\psi|H| \psi\rangle}{\partial \Phi}-\left\langle\psi\left|H \partial_{\Phi}\right| \psi\right\rangle-\left(\partial_{\Phi}\langle\psi|\right) H|\psi\rangle=\frac{\partial E}{\partial \Phi}
\]</span> where we have used the fact that <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> is normalized and, hence, <span class="math inline">\(\partial\langle\psi \mid \psi\rangle / \partial \Phi=0\)</span>. This is the Byers-Yang formula. We discretize this formula by assuming a linear flux threading (we thread the flux <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> very slowly): <span class="math display">\[
I_{y}=\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta \Phi}
\]</span> Here, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta E\)</span> is the energy change in the process of flux insertion. We will see that this change has to do with the potential across the Laughlin cylinder. This is the current along the cylinder, i.e., azimuthal current along the translationally invariant direction. If the system is a bulk insulator, which is what we focus on in this book, not much will happen except at the edges of the system. Even in this case, nothing will happen unless the system is topologically nontrivial and has a Hall conductance. The presence of edges is not just a gimmick: in the absence of edges, there is no way to measure voltage-any time we attach leads to a system, we make an edge. If we put edges on the system, then the system is still an insulator deep in the bulk, but close to the edge, the confining electric field perpendicular to the two edges <span class="math inline">\(E_{x}(L / 2), E_{x}(-L / 2)\)</span> (the field coming from the boundary condition) forces the bands to band upwards and cross the Fermi level. Assume there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bands crossing the Fermi level (where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> could even be zero). We now want to take the flux threaded through the Laughlin cylinder to be exactly a flux quanta. The reason why we want exactly one flux quanta is because, in this case, we know exactly what happens to the system: in an adiabatic insertion, the momentum of all the occupied states changes by <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi / L_{y}\)</span>. This is exactly the momentum level spacing in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -direction. Very close to the edge, after an adiabatic flux insertion, every single band that crosses the Fermi level now has one occupied momenta above the Fermi level on (say) the right edge and one unoccupied momenta below the Fermi level on the left edge of the sample. But the two edges had a potential difference of <span class="math inline">\(V_{x}\)</span> between them, which means that the energy</p>
<p>we are required to provide during the flux insertion (the change in energy <span class="math inline">\(\Delta E\)</span> ) is equal to the energy required to move <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> particles through the potential difference: <span class="math display">\[
\Delta E=n e V_{x}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of bands crossing the Fermi level in a continuous system. Because <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \Phi=1\)</span> (in units of the fundamental flux), we have <span class="math display">\[
\sigma_{x y}=I_{y} / V_{x}=n
\]</span> (in units of <span class="math inline">\(e^{2} / h\)</span> ). This equation, based only on gauge invariance, is true even in a disordered system, as long as we realize that a flux insertion of a unit flux will create edge particle-hole excitations of the system.</p>
<h2 id="the-transfer-matrix-method">The Transfer Matrix Method</h2>
<p>From the Laughlin gauge argument, we have seen that the existence of Hall conductance is intimately linked to the existence of edge modes: the system is a bulk insulator but an edge metal. In the quantum Hall effect, the edge modes have to be chiral (with the chirality given by the magnetic field), which means there has to be a preferred direction on an edge. The number of chiral edge modes on one edge (and antichiral on the opposite edge) has to be equal to the Hall conductance. To gain insight into the existence of edge modes, we now diagonalize the Hamiltonian in a Laughlin geometry - periodic in one direction and open in the other direction See Figure 6.1. We also thread flux, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>, through the cylinder, which adds to the momentum, <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span>. A magnetic field is placed on the lattice, which gives flux <span class="math inline">\(\phi=p / q\)</span> through each plaquette. In the Landau gauge, we can choose the vector potential in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -direction to depend only on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> so we can make the physical situation compatible with periodic boundary conditions in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -direction.</p>
<p>The flux, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>, threaded through the cylinder corresponds to each <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -bond having an extra phase <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi \Phi / L_{y}\)</span>. We again choose the Landau gauge in which <span class="math inline">\(A_{y}=2 \pi \phi m\)</span>, in which case the phases <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{m+1, n ; m, n}=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{m, n+1 ; m, n}=2 \pi \phi m\)</span>. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is, as before, <span class="math display">\[
H=-t_{x} \sum_{m, n} c_{m+1, n}^{\dagger} c_{m, n}-t_{y} e^{i 2 \pi\left(\Phi / L_{y}\right.} \sum_{m, n} c_{m, n+1}^{\dagger} e^{i 2 \pi \phi m} c_{m, n}+\text { h.c. }
\]</span> We now consider two edges on the system, one at <span class="math inline">\(m=L_{x}\)</span> (right after the <span class="math inline">\(L_{x}-1\)</span> site) and one at <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span> (right before the first site). As such, the problem has <span class="math inline">\(L_{x}-1\)</span> sites in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> direction. Because we broke translational invariance in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> -direction by the edges, we can Fourier-transform only in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -direction: <span class="math display">\[
c_{m, n}=\frac{1}{L_{y}} \sum_{k_{y}} e^{i k_{y} n} c_{m}\left(k_{y}\right)
\]</span> The <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -momentum takes the discrete values <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}=2 \pi n_{y} / L_{y}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(n_{y}=0,1, \ldots, L_{y}-1\)</span>. The Hamiltonian becomes <span class="math display">\[
H=\sum_{m, k_{y}}\left[-t_{x} c_{m+1, k_{y}}^{\dagger} c_{m, k_{y}}-t_{y} e^{i 2 \pi\left(\Phi / L_{y}\right)} c_{m, k_{y}}^{\dagger} e^{-i k_{y}+i 2 \pi \phi m} c_{m, k_{y}}+\text { h.c. }\right]
\]</span> Again, considering a one-particle state, <span class="math inline">\(\left|\psi\left(k_{y}, \Phi\right)\right\rangle=\sum_{m} \psi_{m}\left(k_{y}, \Phi\right) c_{m, k_{y}}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\)</span>, we can solve the Schrodinger equation to obtain the difference equation: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
-t_{x}\left(\psi_{m+1}\left(k_{y}, \Phi\right)+\psi_{m-1}\left(k_{y}, \Phi\right)\right)-2 t_{y} \cos \left(k_{y}-2 \pi \frac{\Phi}{L_{y}}-2 \pi \phi m\right) \psi_{m}\left(k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
=E \psi_{m}\left(k_{y}, \Phi\right)
\end{array}
\]</span> This is Harper's equation in real space. It is the Fourier transform with respect to the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> -momentum <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}\)</span> of Harper's equation (5.32), which we previously solved to get the periodic conditions problem in the previous chapter. The preceding equation is no longer translationally invariant by a unit cell in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> -direction due to the existence of <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi \phi m\)</span> in the cosine. However, for <span class="math inline">\(\phi=p / q\)</span>, it is quasi-periodic with a longer period of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> lattice sites in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> direction. This is, of course, the magnetic unit cell we have already discussed. We divide the preceding by <span class="math inline">\(t_{x}\)</span> and represent the equation in a matrix form: <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{m+1}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
\psi_{m}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)
\end{array}\right)=\tilde{M}_{m}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{m}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
\psi_{m-1}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon=E / t_{x}\)</span>. This equation relates the wavefunction at advanced sites, <span class="math inline">\(m+1, m\)</span> to the wavefunction at the previous sites, <span class="math inline">\(m, m-1\)</span>. This is called the transfer matrix formalism, and it was applied to the magnetic field lattice problem by Hatsugai [38] . The site-dependent matrix <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{M}_{m}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{M}_{m}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)=\left(\begin{array}{rr}
-\epsilon-2 \frac{t_{y}}{t_{x}} \cos \left(k_{y}-2 \pi \frac{\Phi}{L_{y}}-2 \pi \phi m\right)&amp;-1 \\
1 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> We drop the explicit functional dependence on <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}, \Phi-\)</span> it is trivial to restore it when needed. Because the system has a natural periodicity in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> -direction via translations by a magnetic unit cell, we take the full length of the system, <span class="math inline">\(L_{x}\)</span>, to be an integer multiple of (commensurate with) <span class="math inline">\(q ; L_{x}=q l\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(l \in Z\)</span>. In this case, several things can be obtained analytically, whereas in the incommensurate case only numerical solutions are available. In this case, we can define a <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -site transfer matrix, which will be our building block for the edge-state theory: <span class="math display">\[
M(\epsilon)=\tilde{M}_{q}(\epsilon) \tilde{M}_{q-1}(\epsilon) \cdots \tilde{M}_{1}(\epsilon) \equiv\left(\begin{array}{ll}
M_{11}(\epsilon) &amp; M_{12}(\epsilon) \\
M_{21}(\epsilon) &amp; M_{22}(\epsilon)
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> where the last equality defines the components of the <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(M(\epsilon)\)</span>. This matrix has not been found analytically and explicitly for any values of <span class="math inline">\(p, q\)</span> but it would be useful for academic purposes if a closed-form solution for at least some of the <span class="math inline">\(p, q\)</span> werefound. Obviously, <span class="math inline">\(M_{11}(\epsilon), M_{12}(\epsilon), M_{21}(\epsilon)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_{22}(\epsilon)\)</span> are polynomials in the energy <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> of degree <span class="math inline">\(q, q-1, q-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q-2\)</span>, respectively. In terms of this matrix, we have the transfer equation <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{q+1}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
\psi_{q}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)
\end{array}\right)=M\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}
\psi_{1}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
\psi_{0}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> which transports the wavefunction all through the magnetic unit cell. Because the system is periodic with <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{M}_{q}(\epsilon) \tilde{M}_{q-1}(\epsilon) \cdots \tilde{M}_{1}(\epsilon)=\tilde{M}_{2 q}(\epsilon) \tilde{M}_{2 q-1}(\epsilon) \cdots \tilde{M}_{q+1}(\epsilon)=M(\epsilon)
\]</span> and so on, which means that for the total length of our commensurate chain, we have the following transfer matrix formula: <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{L_{x}+1}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
\psi_{L_{x}}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)
\end{array}\right)=\left(M\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)\right)^{l}\left(\begin{array}{l}
\psi_{1}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
\psi_{0}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> So far we have done everything except specify the boundary conditions. We now impose open boundary conditions, which, according to figure <span class="math inline">\(6.2\)</span>, means that at sites <span class="math inline">\(0, L_{x}\)</span> there is vanishing wavefunction amplitude, and after that the lattice repeats itself. Basically, the boundary conditions are identical to taking a periodic chain from 0 to <span class="math inline">\(2 L_{x} \equiv 0\)</span> and then slowly turning off the hopping between sites <span class="math inline">\(L_{x}-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_{x}\)</span> and from sites 0 to 1 to make two <span class="math inline">\(L_{x}-1\)</span> chains, each with the boundary conditions <span class="math display">\[
\psi\left(L_{x}\right)=\psi(0)=0
\]</span> The boundary condition imposed on the preceding transfer matrix equation states that <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{L_{x}+1}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
0
\end{array}\right)=\left(M\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)\right)^{l}\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{1}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
0
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> This condition requires that <span class="math display">\[
\left[M^{l}(\epsilon)\right]_{21}=0
\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\left[M^{l}(\epsilon)\right]_{21}\)</span> is a polynomial in <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> of degree <span class="math inline">\(L_{x}-1\)</span>; hence, it has <span class="math inline">\(L_{x}-1\)</span> real roots. These roots are the eigenvalues of the 1-D lattice Hamiltonian and determine the full energy spectrum of the problem. Some of these eigenvalues belong to eigenstates that are in the bulk and some of them belong to eigenstates localized on the edge of the sample (edge states).</p>
<h2 id="edge-modes">Edge Modes</h2>
<p>The eigenvalue in equation (6.18) can be satisfied if the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -site matrix <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> has the property <span class="math display">\[
M_{21}(\epsilon)=0
\]</span> This is so because the product of upper-diagonal matrices is also upper diagonal. We write the <span class="math inline">\(q-1\)</span> solutions of equation (6.19) as <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{j}, j=1, \ldots, q-1\)</span> and order them in ascending order <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i}&lt;\mu_{j}, i&lt;j .\)</span> We can prove that this matrix does not have degeneracies. The transfer matrix equation gives, for a translation of <span class="math inline">\(q k\)</span> sites, <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{q k+1}\left(\mu_{j}, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
0
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
{\left[M_{11}\left(\mu_{j}\right)\right]^{k}} &amp; \# \\
0 &amp; \#
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{1}\left(\mu_{j}, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
0
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> where each # is a quantity that cannot be obtained analytically. Notice the presence of <span class="math inline">\(M_{11}^{k}\)</span> in the first spot of this matrix, which would not have happened if <span class="math inline">\(M_{21} \neq 0\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\psi_{q k+1}}{\psi_{1}}=\left(M_{11}\left(\mu_{j}\right)\right)^{k}
\]</span> Because we want a normalized wavefunction <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{m=1}^{L_{x}-1}\left|\psi_{m}\right|^{2}=1\)</span>, we see that the preceding equation implies that the eigenfunctions are localized on the two different edges or in the bulk, depending on the value of <span class="math inline">\(M_{11}\left(\mu_{j}\right)\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\left|M_{11}\left(\mu_{j}\right)\right|&lt;1 &amp; \rightarrow \frac{\psi_{q k+1}}{\psi_{1}} \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \text { localized at site } 1 \text { -left edge. } \\
\left|M_{11}\left(\mu_{j}\right)\right|&gt;1 &amp; \longrightarrow \frac{\psi_{q k+1}}{\psi_{1}} \rightarrow \infty \rightarrow \text { localized at site } L_{x}-1 \text { -right edge. } \\
M_{11}\left(\mu_{j}\right) \mid=1 &amp; \rightarrow\left|\frac{\psi_{q k+1}}{\psi_{1}}\right|=1 \rightarrow \text { degenerate with, merges into bulk. }
\end{aligned}
\]</span> We have then found how to obtain the edge modes. The rest of the eigenvalues belong to eigenstates that give the bulk modes. Hence, the roots of <span class="math inline">\(\left[M^{l}\right]_{21}(\epsilon)=0-\)</span> but not those of <span class="math inline">\(M_{21}(\epsilon)=0-\)</span> belong to the bulk states.</p>
<h2 id="bulk-bands">Bulk Bands</h2>
<p>If we put periodic boundary conditions in both <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> - and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -directions, the bands disperse in the magnetic BZ with respect to both <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}^{0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span>. Because the length of the magnetic unit cell is equal to <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, we have to take <span class="math inline">\(L_{x}\)</span> to be a multiple of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in the periodic boundary condition case, which is also one of the reasons why we chose it to be a multiple of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> even in the open-boundarycondition case. Then, if instead of doing a Fourier transform and plotting the bands versus both <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}^{0}, k_{y}\)</span>, we only Fourier-transform <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span>, we can simply diagonalize the quasi-1-D lattice Hamiltonian at each <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> to obtain <span class="math inline">\(L_{x} / q\)</span> energies. This is the same number of energies that we would obtain if we Fourier-transformed on <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}^{0}\)</span> because the spacing between two <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}^{0}\)</span> momenta is <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi / L_{x} .\)</span> Equivalently, we could have Fourier-transformed in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, calculated the energy spectrum for all allowed values of <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}^{0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> in the first BZ, and then- for every value of <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}-\)</span> collapsed all the <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}^{0}\)</span> values onto the sameaxis, i.e., the constant <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> line. This will make the bands (at each <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> ) "fat" because, for a single <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span>, there is sizable <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}^{0}\)</span> dispersion, at least in the strong field limit. This collapse of all the <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}^{0}\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> will have (for each band in the <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}^{0}, k_{y}\)</span> space) upper and lower energy bounds, which will disperse with <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span>. An example of this is presented in figure <span class="math inline">\(6.3\)</span>.</p>
<p>The important point of the preceding paragraph is that we can obtain the bulk bands by looking at the system with periodic boundary conditions. In particular, we can obtain the bulk bands from the particular Bloch (periodicity) condition they satisfy, which, in this casebecause the unit cell has length <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -becomes <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{m+q}(\epsilon)=\rho(\epsilon) \psi_{m}(\epsilon)
\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> any lattice site. The Bloch condition says that the proportionality <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\epsilon)\)</span> constant must be a phase <span class="math inline">\(|\rho(\epsilon)|=1\)</span>. If it had not been a phase, the wavefunction would grow or shrink exponentially as we make the system very large, and because for periodic boundary conditions, the system does not have edges, the wavefunction would become unnormalizable, i.e., infinite or vanishing, respectively. Applying the preceding condition to <span class="math inline">\(m=1\)</span>, we find <span class="math display">\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_{q+1}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
\psi_{q}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)
\end{array}\right)=M\left(\begin{array}{l}
\psi_{1}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
\psi_{0}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)
\end{array}\right)=\rho(\epsilon)\left(\begin{array}{l}
\psi_{1}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right) \\
\psi_{0}\left(\epsilon, k_{y}, \Phi\right)
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> Notice <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is an eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>; as such, it satisfies the equation <span class="math display">\[
\rho^{2}-\operatorname{Tr}[M] \rho+\operatorname{Det}[M]=0 .
\]</span> It is trivial to prove, by direct calculation, that <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Det}[M]=\prod_{i=1}^{q} \operatorname{Det}\left[\tilde{M}_{i}\right]=\prod_{i=1}^{q} 1=1\)</span>. Following Hatsugai, we call <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Tr}[M(\epsilon)]=\Delta(\epsilon)\)</span>. The solution for <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is easy to find and takes completely different forms if <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{2}&lt;,&gt;4:\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
\Delta^{2} \leq 4 \rightarrow \rho=\frac{\Delta \pm i \sqrt{4-(\Delta)^{2}}}{2},
\]</span> which is of Bloch form. It is easy to show that, in this case, <span class="math inline">\(|\rho|=1\)</span>. These are the bulk bands to which we return in a moment.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{2}&gt;4\)</span>, the states are the edge modes. This can be seen through direct calculation of powers of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, which is not very inspiring. Another way of seeing that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{2}&gt;4\)</span> implies edge modes is to note that the edge-mode condition <span class="math inline">\(M_{21}(\epsilon)=0\)</span> and the identity <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Det}(M)=1\)</span> (valid for both edge and bulk states) show that at energies of the edge states, we have <span class="math inline">\(M_{11} M_{22}=1\)</span>, which, in turn, implies the following: <span class="math display">\[
\text { Edge modes: }\left(M_{21}=0 ; M_{11} M_{22}=1\right) \rightarrow \Delta=M_{11}+\frac{1}{M_{11}} \rightarrow \Delta^{2} \geq 4
\]</span> We now turn to the bulk bands. Their energies all satisfy <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{2} \leq 4\left(\right.\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(\left.k_{y}\right)\)</span>. Because <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is a polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in the energy <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, the equation <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{2}=4\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(2 q\)</span> solutions <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{i}\)</span>, which can be placed as the lower and upper edges of the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> "fat" bands that we previously mentioned: <span class="math display">\[
\epsilon \in\left[\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}\right], \ldots,\left[\lambda_{2 j-1} \lambda_{2 j}\right], \ldots,\left[\lambda_{2 q-1}, \lambda_{2 q}\right], \quad \lambda_{i} \leq \lambda_{j}, i&lt;j
\]</span> The lower and upper boundaries of the bulk-band regions are <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{2 j-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{2 j} .\)</span> Everything in between them gets filled when we diagonalize the problem on a large <span class="math inline">\(L_{x}\)</span> chain. The band edges, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{i}\)</span>, come from <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=\pm 2\)</span>. This is rather clear because for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{2}&gt;4\)</span>, we have gaps or, at most, edge modes, whereas for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \leq 4\)</span>, we have bands. So, the edges of the bands must come from <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta|^{2}=4\)</span> if the function <span class="math inline">\(\Delta(\epsilon)\)</span> is to be smooth, which it is because it is a polynomial in <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. Solutions for which both <span class="math inline">\(M_{21}=0\)</span> have the extra property that they give the points at which the edge modes touch the bulk bands. These, of course, have <span class="math inline">\(M_{11}=\pm 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Laughlin gauge argument has taught us that the Hall conductance equals the number of chiral states localized on one edge. However, from the exact diagonalization results presented in figure <span class="math inline">\(6.4\)</span> we can see that the edge states on a single edge can be both chiral (have positive slope at some <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> ) and antichiral (have negative slope at some other <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span> ) while belonging to the same edge. This happens only in the high-field limit, in which the bulk bands have strong dispersion; in the weak-field limit, the bulk bands become very thin and effectively nondispersive (in the limit of the weak field, they are Landau levels), and the edge modes on one given (left or right) edge are either all chiral or all antichiral. When the edge mode contains both chiral and antichiral components on one edge, the Hall conductance is given by the linking number of the edge with the constant Fermi level in the gap. An example of how to compute linking numbers is given in figure <span class="math inline">\(6.5 .\)</span> The linking number has an orientation, as seen in figure <span class="math inline">\(6.5 .\)</span> The Hall conductance is identical to the linking number by virtue of Laughlin's argument.</p>
