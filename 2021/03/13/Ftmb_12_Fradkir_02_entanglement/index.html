<p>相变的经典与量子</p>
<p>In most cases the phases of quantum field theories, in particular those of interest in condensed matter physics, can be described in terms of the behavior of local observables, such as order parameters or currents that transform properly under the symmetries of the theory. Quantum and thermal phase transitions are characterized by the behavior of these observables as a function of temperature and of the coupling constants of the theory. The phase transitions themselves, quantum or thermal, are classified into universality classes, which are represented by the critical exponents which specify the scaling laws of the expectation values of the observables. Historically, the development of this approach to critical behavior goes back to the Landau theory of critical behavior. It acquired its most complete form with the development of the renormalization group <span class="math inline">\(( RG )\)</span> in the late <span class="math inline">\(1960 s\)</span> and early <span class="math inline">\(1970 s .\)</span> It is the centerpiece of Wilson's approach to quantum field theory, in which all local quantum field theories are defined by the scaling regime of a physical system near a continuous phase transition. From this point of view there is no fundamental difference between classical (or thermal) phase transitions, which are described by the theory of classical critical behavior, and quantum phase transitions.</p>
<p>经典的热相变</p>
<p>For example, the expectation value of a local order parameter <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as the thermal phase transition is approached from below behaves as <span class="math display">\[
M \sim\left(T_{ c }-T\right)^{\beta}
\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> is the critical temperature and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is a critical exponent that depends on the universality class of the thermal phase transition and on the dimensionality of space. While quantum mechanics can play a key role in the existence of the ordered phase, e.g. superfluidity and superconductivity are macroscopic manifestations of essentially quantum-mechanical phenomena, the thermal transition itself is governed entirely by classical statistical mechanics, and quantum mechanics plays a role in setting the value of non-universal quantities such as the critical temperature, etc.</p>
<p>量子相变</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the case of a quantum phase transition, the order parameter <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> has a similar scaling behavior as a function of the coupling constant <span class="math display">\[
M \sim\left(g_{ c }-g\right)^{\tilde{\beta}}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the coupling constant, <span class="math inline">\(g_{ c }\)</span> is the critical coupling constant, and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\beta}\)</span> is a critical exponent that depends on the universality class of the quantum phase transition. Here we assume that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> has a non-vanishing expectation value only for <span class="math inline">\(g&lt;g_{ c }\)</span> However, as is apparent in the description of a quantum phase transition in terms of a path integral in imaginary time, quantum phase transitions look like classical phase transitions in a space with an extra dimension, imaginary time.</p>
<p>区别</p>
<p>The main difference between the two types of transitions is the existence of a dynamical critical exponent <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> that specifies how space and time scale in the quantum case. This scaling law is absent in the theory of equilibrium classical critical phenomena. In the case of quantum systems that obey relativistic invariance the dynamical exponent <span class="math inline">\(z=1,\)</span> and, in these cases, the quantum transition is literally a classical transition in a space with one additional dimension. Thus, near a continuous quantum phase transition the correlation length diverges with a universal exponent <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\xi \sim\left|g-g_{ c }\right|^{-v},\)</span> while the energy gap <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> vanishes at the same quantum phase transition as <span class="math inline">\(G \sim\left|g-g_{ c }\right|^{v z}\)</span></p>
<p>规范理论</p>
<p>Gauge theories, which we discussed in other chapters in connection with the physics of the topological fluids and spin liquids, have a similar description. The crucial difference is that in the case of gauge theory the local nature of the gauge symmetry requires the consideration of non-local gauge-invariant observables, such as the Wilson loop and the 't Hooft loop. As we saw in Chapter <span class="math inline">\(9,\)</span> the Wilson loop operators have distinct behaviors in different phases of the theory, and obey an area law in a confining phase and a perimeter law in a deconfined phase. Hence, near a continuous phase transition the energy gap of the gauge theory, which is set by the string tension in the confining phase and enters into the definition of the area law, vanishes as a function of the coupling constant with a universal critical exponent.</p>
<p>In Chapter 9 we saw that gauge theories with a compact gauge group have non-trivial topological properties in their deconfined phases. Likewise, ChernSimons gauge theory is a topological field theory, see Chapter <span class="math inline">\(10,\)</span> and we used it extensively in the field-theoretic description of the fractional quantum Hall fluids. In topological field theories the expectation values of the observables depend only on the topological properties of the observables, such as the linking number of the Wilson loops, and on the global topology of the space. In condensed matter physics topological field theories describe the effective low-energy and long-distance behavior in a topological phase. The best-understood example of a system in a topological phase is a fractional quantum Hall fluid, see Chapters 13 and <span class="math inline">\(14 .\)</span> The consideration of topological phases, and of topological field theories, led us to describe the excitations by their transformation properties under the braid group, and led to the concept of abelian and non-abelian fractional statistics. More generally, we also had to consider the quantum dimensions of the excitations and their fusion rules.</p>
<p>Although in all cases of interest the quantum phase transition itself can be described in terms of the behavior of local operators, the existence of topological phases tells us that some important features of the theory cannot be reduced to local physics. This raises the question of whether perhaps even at the quantum phase transition some global non-local properties of the quantum field theory may be important. The topological properties of the topological phases have a quantum origin and do not have a counterpart in classical systems. This raises the need to consider other tools to describe topological phases and their phase transitions.</p>
<p>物理系统的所有静态特性的信息都存储在基态波函数中</p>
<p>The information on all the static properties of a physical system is stored in its ground-state wave function. This naturally includes the behavior of the equal-time correlators of local operators. Since we can compute their properties directly, we did not need to investigate the properties of the ground-state wave functions. In general, the wave functions do not by themselves play a great role since the wave functions of thermodynamically large systems contain all kinds of information, much of which is highly non-universal and depends on all the microscopic details. In almost all cases very little of the nature of the physical system would change if these microscopic details were to be modified. In addition, it is often more difficult to understand the physical properties of a system by staring at an expression of the wave function than to look at the correlators of the local observables. Of course, if we know the behavior of the observables, we know the information that is encoded in the wave functions. One may nevertheless ask whether there is important physical information encoded in the wave functions that might not be readily accessible via properties gleaned from the behavior of local operators. For instance, the wave function for the ground state of the spin-1/2 quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain obtained using the Bethe ansatz (see Chapter 5 ) has been known since Hans Bethe derived it in 1931 . However, the physics that was encoded in this wave function could not be understood until the properties of correlators of local observables were found many years later, beginning in the <span class="math inline">\(1970 s\)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the wave functions that describe systems in topological phases, e.g. the Laughlin wave function of the fractional quantum Hall effect, have manifestly universal properties that are closely related to the properties and characterization of these phases. We saw in Chapters 13 and 14 that the wave functions of topological phases encode universal non-local properties of these systems such as the braiding fractional statistics of their excitations. Therefore, at least in these cases, we need an understanding of non-local properties of the ground-state wave functions.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-entanglement">2 Quantum entanglement</h2>
<p>The natural tool to investigate the non-local properties stored in the groundstate wave functions is the concept of quantum entanglement and the associated entanglement entropy. In this chapter we will define what is meant by quantum entanglement and its measures, focusing on the entanglement entropy. The concept of quantum entanglement was born with quantum mechanics itself, and predates our motivations by many decades (Einstein et al., 1935 ).</p>
<p>Historically the concept of quantum entanglement was formulated to describe how a finite quantum system is coupled to its essentially infinite environment. The prime example is the non-local information stored in the wave functions of systems of identical particles. Consider, for instance, a system of two identical spin- <span class="math inline">\(1 / 2\)</span> particles, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. The wave function of a spin-singlet state, with total spin <span class="math inline">\(S=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_{z}=0,\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
|0,0\rangle=(1 / \sqrt{2})(|\uparrow, \downarrow\rangle-|\downarrow, \uparrow\rangle) 
\]</span> Since this wave function does not contain any length scale, the physical size of the spin singlet can be as large as we want. If we measure the spin of particle <span class="math inline">\(A ,\)</span> say on Earth, and find that it is <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span> then, provided that we know a priori that the state is indeed a spin singlet, we know that the spin of particle <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\downarrow\)</span> even if particle <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is, let us say, on the Moon. On the other hand, if the two spins are in a product state, such as <span class="math inline">\(|1,\pm 1\rangle,\)</span> the measurement of the spin of particle <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to be <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span> implies that the spin of particle <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow\)</span> only if we know both that <span class="math inline">\(S=1\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(S_{z}=1\)</span>. For this reason we say that the spins are entangled in the singlet state, while in the product state they are not.</p>
<p>A measure of the degree of entanglement of a quantum state is the von Neumann entanglement entropy, which is defined as follows. Let us consider a partition of a physical system <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> into two disjoint subsystems that we will label by <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma=A \bigcup B\)</span> and the two subsystems have a vanishing intersection, <span class="math inline">\(A \bigcap B=\emptyset\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(H _{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H _{B}\)</span> be the Hilbert spaces of the states with separate support in system <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and in system <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> such that the Hilbert space of the states on <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(H _{\Sigma}= H _{A} \oplus H _{B} .\)</span> Let <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> be a pure quantum state of the system on <span class="math inline">\(A \bigcup B .\)</span> As such it can be decomposed as <span class="math display">\[
|\Psi\rangle=\sum_{m, n} M_{m, n}\left|\psi_{n}^{A}\right\rangle\left|\psi_{m}^{B}\right\rangle
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left\{\left|\psi_{n}^{A}\right\rangle\right\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\left|\psi_{m}^{B}\right\rangle\right\}\)</span> are orthonormal basis states of <span class="math inline">\(H _{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H _{B},\)</span> respectively,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(M_{n, m}\)</span> are the matrix elements of an (in general) rectangular matrix M.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, using the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) theorem, a rectangular matrix can always be written as a product of</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a unitary matrix <span class="math inline">\(U ,\)</span></li>
<li>a diagonal matrix <span class="math inline">\(D =\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{diag}\left(\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{n}, \ldots\right),\)</span></li>
<li>and a rectangular matrix <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> (whose rows are orthonormal vectors).</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, after going to the new bases <span class="math display">\[
\left|\psi_{n}^{A}\right\rangle \rightarrow U \left|\psi_{n}^{A}\right\rangle\\
\left|\psi_{m}^{B}\right\rangle \rightarrow V \left|\psi_{m}^{B}\right\rangle
\]</span> we find the Schmidt decomposition of the state vector <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
|\Psi\rangle=\sum_{n}^{D} \lambda_{n}\left|\psi_{n}^{A}\right\rangle\left|\psi_{n}^{B}\right\rangle
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(D=\min \left\{d_{A}, d_{B}\right\}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(d_{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_{B}\)</span> being the dimensions of the Hilbert spaces <span class="math inline">\(H _{A}\)</span> abd <span class="math inline">\(H _{B}\)</span>. Also, if the state vector <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> is normalized to unity, <span class="math inline">\(\|\Psi\|=1\)</span>, then the set of (generally complex) numbers <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\lambda_{n}\right\}\)</span> must satisfy the sum rule <span class="math display">\[
\sum_{n}^{D}\left|\lambda_{n}\right|^{2}=1
\]</span> Given the pure state <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> of the total system <span class="math inline">\(A \bigcup B,\)</span> its (trivial) density matrix is <span class="math display">\[
\rho_{A} \cup_{B}=|\Psi\rangle\langle\Psi|
\]</span> We can now define the reduced density matrix for subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to be the partial trace of <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A} \cup_{B}\)</span> over the degrees of freedom in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\rho_{A}=\operatorname{tr}_{B} \rho_{A} \cup B
\]</span> and similarly for the reduced density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{B}\)</span>. Therefore, if we observe only the subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> it is in a mixed state defined by the reduced density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A},\)</span> and similarly for <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p>The von Neumann entanglement entropy <span class="math inline">\(S_{A}\)</span> for subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> when the total system is in state <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle,\)</span> is defined to be the entropy of the reduced density matrix, <span class="math display">\[
S_{A} \equiv-\operatorname{tr}_{A}\left(\rho_{A} \ln \rho_{A}\right)
\]</span> (For historical reasons in the quantum-information literature the von Neumann entropy uses log <span class="math inline">\(_{2}\)</span> instead of the standard natural logarithm used in statistical mechanics.)</p>
<p>Using the Schmidt decomposition, Eq. (17.2), we can write the reduced density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A}\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[
\rho_{A}=\sum_{n}^{D}\left|\lambda_{n}\right|^{2}\left|\psi_{n}^{A}\right\rangle\left\langle\psi_{n}^{A}\right|
\]</span> and similarly for <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Hence, the quantities <span class="math inline">\(p_{n} \equiv\left|\lambda_{n}\right|^{2}\)</span> represent the probability of observing the subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in the state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\psi_{n}^{A}\right\rangle .\)</span> From these expressions it follows that the reduced density matrices <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{B}\)</span> have the same non-zero eigenvalues, that they are given by <span class="math inline">\(p_{n}=\left|\lambda_{n}\right|^{2},\)</span> and that both reduced density matrices have unit <span class="math display">\[
\text { trace, } \operatorname{tr}_{A} \rho_{A}=\operatorname{tr}_{B} \rho_{B}=1
\]</span> It also follows that the von Neumann entanglement entropy can be written as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
S_{A}&amp;=-\operatorname{tr}_{A}\left(\rho_{A} \ln \rho_{A}\right)\\&amp;=-\sum_{n}^{D}\left|\lambda_{n}\right|^{2} \ln \left|\lambda_{n}\right|^{2}\\&amp;=-\operatorname{tr}_{B}\left(\rho_{B} \ln \rho_{B}\right)\\&amp;=S_{B} \\
\end{aligned}
\]</span> In other words, the entanglement entropy is symmetric in the two (entangled) subsystems. This symmetry property is a consequence of our assumption that the total system <span class="math inline">\(A \bigcup B\)</span> is in a pure state <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle .\)</span> Conversely, the symmetry property of the entanglement entropy does not hold if the total system is in a mixed state, e.g. in a thermal state defined by a Gibbs density matrix. The expression of the von Neumann entanglement entropy in terms of the probabilities <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\left|\lambda_{n}\right|^{2}\right\}\)</span> also tells us that the entanglement entropy can vanish only if the reduced density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A}\)</span> (and hence also <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{B}\)</span> ) itself represents a pure state. This can hold only if the state <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> of the system on <span class="math inline">\(A \bigcup B\)</span> is a product state. In this case the reduced density matrix is diagonal and equal to <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A}=\operatorname{diag}(1,0, \ldots, 0),\)</span> which has a vanishing entropy. Therefore the von Neumann entropy is a measure of the entanglement of the two subsystems <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in state <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle .\)</span> The spectrum of (Schmidt) eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\left|\lambda_{n}\right|^{2}\right\}\)</span> of the reduced density matrix is known as the entanglement spectrum.</p>
<p>Finally, the von Neumann entanglement entropy satisfies the following properties.

<p>For the rest of this chapter we will focus on entanglement entropy, how it is computed, and how it behaves in different systems of interest. We will see that the entanglement entropy is a very efficient and powerful tool to characterize the physics of topological phases in condensed matter and in quantum field theory. We will also discuss in detail the scaling laws obeyed by the entanglement entropy.</p>
<p>How do we compute the entanglement entropy in an extended, macroscopic, system such as a quantum field theory? In systems with few degrees of freedom it is relatively straightforward to construct the reduced density matrices directly from their wave functions. However, except for a few exceptional cases, the wave functions of systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom are in almost all circumstances forbiddingly complex. There are a few exceptional systems in which the wave functions are known explicitly and have universal properties. However, even for these cases the computation of the entanglement entropy is non-trivial.</p>
<p>For definiteness let us consider a field theory with a Euclidean action <span class="math inline">\(S[\phi]=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\int_{\Omega} d^{D} x L [\phi],\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is some field and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the Lagrangian density. Here <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is some <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> -dimensional space-time manifold. In the Euclidean theory the imaginarytime coordinate <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is periodic (compactified) with period <span class="math inline">\(\beta=1 / T,\)</span> while the space directions are for now arbitrary. Thus, we will generally refer to the space-time <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span></p>
<p>as a cylinder of circumference <span class="math inline">\(\beta=1 / T\)</span>. What follows does not depend on whether the theory is relativistic or not.</p>
<p>The Gibbs density matrix of the system is <span class="math inline">\(\rho=\exp (-\beta H),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is the quantum Hamiltonian and <span class="math inline">\(\beta=1 / T\)</span>. The partition function is <span class="math display">\[
Z=\operatorname{tr} \rho=\operatorname{tr} e^{-\beta H}=\int D \phi e^{-\int_{\Omega} d^{D} x L [\phi]}
\]</span> In the Euclidean metric the imaginary-time <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> evolution operator is <span class="math inline">\(U(\tau)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\exp (-\tau H) .\)</span> For large <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> the Euclidean evolution operator <span class="math inline">\(U(\tau)\)</span> projects any initial state onto the ground-state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle .\)</span> Therefore, the ground-state wave function <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{0}[\phi]\)</span> is expressed in terms of a path integral by a similar-looking expression (see Fig. 17.1)</p>

This last step projects onto the ground state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> , assuming that it is unique. If the ground state is not unique, the evolution will project onto a state that is the linear superposition of the degenerate vacua (ground states), unless of course the degeneracy is explicitly lifted. Similarly, the matrix element of the density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> between states <span class="math inline">\(|\phi(x)\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left|\phi^{\prime}(x)\right\rangle\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S_{ E }[\phi]\)</span> is the Euclidean action of the field theory on a manifold that is a strip of width <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> with the specified boundary conditions.</p>
<p>We can use the same approach to, at least formally, find a path-integral expression for the reduced density matrix. So, once again we will consider a partition of the spatial manifold into two disjoint sets <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. The reduced thermal density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A}\)</span> is then obtained by tracing over the degrees of freedom in its complement, region <span class="math inline">\(B .\)</span> Hence we will require that in region <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> the initial and final states are the same and summed over, and the imaginary-time coordinate is periodic with period <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. Thus, in region <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> the strip is wrapped into a cylinder of circumference <span class="math inline">\(\beta .\)</span> Let <span class="math inline">\(\left|\left[\phi_{A}(x)\right]\right\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left|\left[\phi_{A}^{\prime}(x)\right]\right\rangle\)</span> be two field configurations with support in region <span class="math inline">\(A .\)</span> The matrix elements of the reduced density matrix for region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> are obtained by computing a trace of the full density matrix restricted to the states in region <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. However, in region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> the states evolve from the state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\left[\phi_{A}(x)\right]\right\rangle\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\left|\left[\phi_{A}^{\prime}(x)\right]\right\rangle .\)</span> In other words, the new manifold is smooth and periodic on region <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> but has a cut in region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> with a discontinuity expressed in terms of the two configurations specified by the states <span class="math inline">\(\left|\left[\phi_{A}(x)\right]\right\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left|\left[\phi_{A}^{\prime}(x)\right]\right\rangle\)</span> (see Fig. 17.2)</p>

\]</span></p>
<p>To compute the entanglement entropy we will use the "replica trick." To this end, we compute first <span class="math display">\[
Z_{n}[A]=\operatorname{tr}_{A} \rho_{A}^{n}
\]</span> which is defined for all positive integers <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. In terms of the spectrum of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\lambda_{k}\right\}\)</span> (the entanglement spectrum), it becomes <span class="math display">\[
Z_{n}[A]=\sum_{k}^{D} \lambda_{k}^{n}
\]</span> Since the spectrum of eigenvalues lies within the interval [0,1] and obeys the normalization condition <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{k}^{D} \lambda_{k}=1,\)</span> the trace (defined by <span class="math inline">\(\left.Z_{n}[A]\right)\)</span> is absolutely convergent and analytic for <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Re} n&gt;1\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(Z_{n}[A]\)</span> can be extended by analytic continuation to the complex- <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> plane as <span class="math inline">\(Z[n, A]\)</span>.</p>
<p>The von Neumann entanglement entropy <span class="math inline">\(S_{A}\)</span> is computed by taking the limit (Callan and Wilczek, 1994; Calabrese and Cardy, 2004) <span class="math display">\[
S_{A}=-\operatorname{tr}\left(\rho_{A} \ln \rho_{A}\right)=-\lim _{n \rightarrow 1^{+}} \frac{\partial}{\partial n} \operatorname{tr}_{A} \rho_{A}^{n}
\]</span> We will also define the Rényi entropies <span class="math inline">\(S_{A}^{n}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
S_{A}^{n}=\frac{1}{1-n} \ln \operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}
\]</span> Since we are taking traces of matrix products, it is clear that the final state in region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of one factor is the initial state of the next factor (also in region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> ). The overall trace means that the final state of the last factor is identified with the initial state of the first factor. This means that the manifold on which the path integral is computed can be regarded as an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -sheeted Riemann surface in region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> with overall imaginary-time span <span class="math inline">\(n \beta\)</span> glued to cylinders defined for region <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> each with imaginary-time span <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can think of this calculation as involving <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> identical copies of the field theory, and hence having <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> copies or replicas of the fields <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{i}(i=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(1, \ldots, n),\)</span> each with the same action such that in region <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> the replicas obey periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time separately, whereas in region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> they are identified with each other sequentially and cyclically. More specifically, the replicated fields obey the boundary conditions <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
\phi_{j}\left(0^{+}, x\right)=\phi_{j+1}\left(0^{-}, x\right), \quad \text { for } x \in A \\
\phi_{j}\left(0^{+}, x\right)=\phi_{j}\left(0^{-}, x\right), \quad \text { for } x \in B
\end{array}
\]</span> A consequence of the boundary conditions that specify how the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> replicas are glued to each other is that there exists a set of twist operators that act on the replicated theory and identify the different copies at the cuts. At the common boundary between regions <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> the fields have a conical singularity. This formulation is originally due to Holzhey, Larsen, and Wilczek (Holzhey et al., 1994 ), and was developed and extended by Calabrese and Cardy (2004, 2009), whose work we follow here.</p>
<p>Following Calabrese and Cardy, we define a partition function with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> copies of the field, obeying the boundary conditions of Eq. (17.17). The action of the replicated fields is simply the sum of the actions for each copy, <span class="math display">\[
S\left[\phi_{1}, \ldots, \phi_{n}\right]=\sum_{i=1}^{n} S\left[\phi_{i}\right]
\]</span> The path integral, the partition function, is then restricted by the condition that the local fields <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\phi_{i}\right\}\)</span> are glued according to the boundary conditions of Eq. (17.17). The replicated theory thus defined now has a global symmetry since it is invariant under the exchange of the replicas. Local fields that obey these conditions are called twist fields. With the particular structure of the boundary conditions we are using, they are called branch-point twist fields, and are associated with two cyclic permutation symmetries, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma: j \rightarrow j+1(\bmod n)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{-1}: j+1 \rightarrow j(\bmod n)(\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(j=1, \ldots, n) .\)</span> The branch-cut twist fields that map the different copies across the branch cuts are denoted by <span class="math inline">\(T _{n} \equiv T _{\sigma},\)</span> associated with the permutation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma: j \rightarrow j+1\)</span> <span class="math inline">\((\bmod n),\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{ T }_{n} \equiv T _{\sigma^{-1}},\)</span> associated with the (inverse) permutation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{-1}: j+1 \rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(j(\bmod n) .\)</span> Thus, the reduced density matrix, which we defined as the partition function with a branch cut on every point along the boundary between regions <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> amounts to a partition function in the replicated theory with insertions of the branch-cut twist fields along the boundary between the two regions. A detailed treatment of this approach can be found in the work of Cardy and coworkers (Cardy et al., 2007 ). This formulation is particularly powerful in ( <span class="math inline">\(1+1\)</span> ) dimensions.</p>
<h2 id="the-area-law">4 The area law</h2>
<p>So far, much of the discussion in this chapter has been on the formal aspects of how entanglement and entanglement entropy are defined. As the reader can easily see, the expressions we have presented are rather formal. They are also very nonlocal. Although there are many reasons for being interested in entanglement, the complexity and non-locality of these measures have prevented the development of a comprehensive theory. However, in recent years there has been a sustained effort devoted to understanding the properties of entanglement measures (and of entanglement entropy in particular) in quantum field theory, in gravity, in string theory, and more recently in condensed matter physics. Different motivations have converged on this problem.</p>
<p>One of the main motivations for work on entanglement originates from the physics of black holes. In spite of their origin in a classical theory, the general theory of relativity, black holes behave as if they were thermodynamic objects that have entropy and temperature. A fundamental result in black-hole physics is the expression for the black-hole entropy (Bekenstein, 1973 ; Hawking, 1975 ) <span class="math display">\[
S_{ BH }=\frac{1}{4 \ell_{ P }^{2}} A
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the area of the event horizon of the black hole, <span class="math inline">\(\ell_{ P }=\sqrt{\hbar G_{ N } / c^{3}}\)</span> is the Planck length, and <span class="math inline">\(G_{ N }\)</span> is the Newton constant. This formula, known as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole, is most intriguing. Since black holes are some of the most classical objects in the Universe (or universe?), it is unclear what this entropy actually means.</p>
<p>The way the Bekenstein-Hawking formula was originally derived involved the idea that near the strong gravitational fields of a black hole pair production would exist. The existence of these processes then implies that some form of radiation, Hawking radiation, should be produced in the vicinity of the black hole, and hence these objects would acquire thermal properties such as a temperature. In addition, there are many examples in general relativity of so-called extremal black holes, which have entropy but no temperature. In particular, if a particle-anti-particle pair is created by the gravitational field of the black hole, the pair will be in an entangled state. One is then led to assume that the black-hole entropy must have a relation with entanglement entropy.</p>
<p>So the following question arises: if they have entropy, what degrees of freedom are being counted by this entropy? One of the triumphs of modern string theory is that it offers an explanation for the black-hole entropy that is consistent with statistical mechanics (Maldacena and Strominger, 1996 ). On the other hand, since some fraction of the particles produced by pair production would fall into the black hole and hence disappear for ever, this led to the idea that, once a black hole has formed, the system somehow on its own evolves into a mixed quantum state, since some information seems to be eaten by the black hole. This notion is in conflict with quantum mechanics since it violates unitary time evolution. This problem has led to a profound examination of the relation among gravitation, quantum mechanics, and information (Susskind, 2008 ).</p>
<p>If one assumes that the black-hole entropy is entanglement entropy, the Bekenstein-Hawking area law motivates the question of whether quantum field theory itself is consistent with this law. This problem was first studied by Bombelli, Koul, and Sorkin (Bombelli et al., 1986 ) and by Srednicki (1993), who found that in the case of a free massive relativistic scalar field of mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of linear size <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> in the limit <span class="math inline">\(\ell \gg m^{-1}\)</span> behaves as <span class="math display">\[
S[\ell]=\alpha \ell^{d-1}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the dimensionality of space and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a dimension-full, and hence nonuniversal, constant. Here, by non-universality we mean that it depends explicitly on the short-distance cutoff, e.g. the lattice spacing <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or the momentum cutoff <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda \sim a^{-1} .\)</span> The non-universal character of the coefficient of the area law in Eq. (17.20) indicates that it is governed by the short-distance correlations encoded in the wave function. However, in contrast with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, the area law of the entanglement entropy of local field theories cannot be expressed in terms of a fundamental length and depends on the explicit way in which the theory is cut off at short distances.</p>
<p>For example, in the case of a free scalar field in <span class="math inline">\((d+1)\)</span> space-time dimensions, the entanglement entropy for a spherical region in <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> space dimensions can be expressed in terms of the two-point function of the free massive scalar field in the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -sheeted geometry, see e.g. Calabrese and Cardy (2004), Casini et al. (2005), and Casini and Huerta <span class="math inline">\((2005,2009),\)</span> resulting in the expression <span class="math display">\[
\ln \operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}= A \frac{1}{24}\left(n-\frac{1}{n}\right) \int \frac{d^{d-1} k_{\perp}}{(2 \pi)^{d-1}} \ln \left(k_{\perp}^{2}+m^{2}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k_{\perp}\)</span> acts on the <span class="math inline">\(d-1\)</span> non-radial coordinates. From here it follows that the von Neumann entanglement entropy for the spherical region has an area law <span class="math display">\[
S=-\frac{ A }{12} \int \frac{d^{d-1} k_{\perp}}{(2 \pi)^{d-1}} \ln \left(\frac{k_{\perp}^{2}+m^{2}}{k_{\perp}^{2}+a^{-2}}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the area of the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> -dimensional hypersphere and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the short-distance cutoff. This integral diverges as <span class="math inline">\(a^{-(d-1)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the entanglement entropy of free massive scalar fields is subextensive and scales as the area of the observed region, instead of the volume of a region as in the case of the thermodynamic entropy. This result holds essentially for all local theories. Since the area law follows from short-distance physics, it should apply equally to systems in the non-critical regime and to quantum critical systems. The only known exception to the strict area-law scaling is the case of systems of fermions at finite density, i.e. with a Fermi surface, where it has been shown that the entanglement entropy scales instead as <span class="math inline">\(S_{A} \sim L^{d-1} \ln L\)</span> (Gioev and Klich, <span class="math inline">\(2006 ;\)</span> Wolf, 2006 ), which is still sub-extensive. The sub-extensive scaling of the entanglement entropy is a necessary condition for the success of quantuminformation-based approaches to the simulation of quantum critical systems such as the projected entangled-pair-state representation of quantum states on <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> lattices (Verstraete et al., 2006<span class="math inline">\()\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="entanglement-entropy-in-conformal-field-theory">5 Entanglement entropy in conformal field theory</h2>
<p>The generic existence of the area-law result naturally poses the following question: what scaling law does the entanglement entropy obey in a quantum critical system? In particular, what is the manifestation of the expected universal behavior of a quantum critical system in the entanglement entropy? One expects to find universal contributions to the entanglement entropy. But then the next logical question is to ask what determines these universal contributions and how they are related to the scaling of local observables at a quantum critical point.</p>
<p>To this date there isn't a generally known answer to these questions. However, these issues have been investigated in several important cases: (a) CFTs in <span class="math inline">\((1+1)\)</span> dimensions, (b) the <span class="math inline">\((2+1)\)</span> -dimensional quantum Lifshitz universality class (see Section 9.15 ), and <span class="math inline">\(( c ) \phi^{4}\)</span> field theory in the <span class="math inline">\(4-\epsilon\)</span> expansion. In this section we will describe the <span class="math inline">\((1+1)\)</span> -dimensional case.</p>
<p>The scaling behavior of the entanglement von Neumann entropy can be determined by general arguments of CFT. We will follow here in detail the arguments and results of Calabrese and Cardy (Calabrese and Cardy, 2004; Calabrese et al., 2009 ), which in turn are an extension of the early work of Holzhey, Larsen, and Wilczek (Holzhey et al., 1994 ). We will use the representation of <span class="math inline">\(Z_{n}[A]=\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}\)</span> in terms of a path integral with a replicated target space.</p>
<p>For simplicity region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> will be a segment of length <span class="math inline">\(\ell,\)</span> and region <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the complement. The entire system has length <span class="math inline">\(L \gg \ell\)</span>. We will work in the long distance limit and hence assume that <span class="math inline">\(\ell \gg a,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a microscopic spatial cutoff, e.g. the lattice spacing. We will compute <span class="math inline">\(Z_{n}\)</span> and from there we will determine the von Neumann entanglement entropy. This problem was also considered in the context of specific lattice systems, such as quantum spin chains. The main result that we will prove is that in this limit, that provided the system is quantum critical, the entanglement entropy has the behavior <span class="math display">\[
S=\frac{c}{3} \ln \left(\frac{\ell}{a}\right)+\text { finite terms }+O\left(\ell^{-1}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the central charge of the Virasoro algebra associated with the specific CFT that describes the <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> quantum critical point. From the point of view of the area law this result is expected, since in one dimension the boundaries are sets of points. Hence, as <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow 1,\)</span> the area law can become a logarithm in one dimension. In this case, a redefinition of the microscopic cutoff will change the <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> terms in the expansion of Eq. (17.23) but cannot change the prefactor of the logarithm. Hence the prefactor must be a universal quantity, which, we will see, is related to the central charge <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> discussed in Section <span class="math inline">\(7.11 .\)</span> However, the finite terms have nonuniversal contributions. On the other hand, if the logarithmic contributions were absent, the finite terms should be universal. We will see below an example of this case in two space dimensions.</p>
<p>The existence of universal terms in the finite-size scaling of the entanglement entropy is important since they signal the existence of large-scale entanglement. Indeed, although the area-law term is the most singular term as a function of the size of the observed region, the (generally subleading) universal term indicates that it measures the contributions to the entanglement entropy from all length scales. We will see that the entanglement entropy generally has a universal term in systems at quantum criticality, i.e. whose effective field theory displays scale and conformal invariance, and in topological phases.</p>
<p>In the replica formulation the replicated fields become twisted by the non-trivial boundary conditions. The fields are twisted by the exchange symmetries, which are represented by the local twist fields <span class="math inline">\(T _{n}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T _{n}^{-1}\)</span>, respectively. The local twist fields <span class="math inline">\(T _{n}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T _{n}^{-1}\)</span> act at the boundary between the two regions <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> and effectively serve to link the different copies of the CFT with each other. In the case of a single interval with endpoints at the spatial coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x=u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x=v,\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\ell=|u-v|\)</span>, the partition function is to be calculated on fields on a Riemann surface with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> sheets. In two dimensions we can expect to be able to compute this object as a path integral for replicated fields on the complex plane <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> where the Riemann surface is specified by a set of boundary conditions, Eq. (17.17). For the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -sheeted Riemann surface along interval <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> the partition function <span class="math inline">\(Z_{n}[A]\)</span> becomes <span class="math display">\[
Z_{n}[A] \sim\left\langle T _{n}(u, 0) T _{n}^{-1}(v, 0)\right\rangle
\]</span> where the expectation value is computed from the replica theory on the complex plane. The role of the operators <span class="math inline">\(T _{n}(u, 0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T _{n}^{-1}(v, 0)\)</span> is to enforce the boundary conditions of Eq. (17.17). Similarly, the expectation value of an operator in sheet <span class="math inline">\(i=1, \ldots, n, O (x, \tau ; i),\)</span> on the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -sheeted Riemann surface is <span class="math display">\[
\langle O (x, \tau ; i)\rangle=\frac{\left\langle O (x, \tau ; i) T _{n}(u, 0) T _{n}^{-1}(v, 0)\right\rangle}{\left\langle T _{n}(u, 0) T _{n}^{-1}(v, 0)\right\rangle}
\]</span> In the thermodynamic limit in which the length of the system <span class="math inline">\(L \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, the conformal mapping <span class="math display">\[
\zeta=\frac{w-u}{w-v}
\]</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(w=x+i \tau\)</span> ) maps the branch points to <span class="math inline">\((0, \infty)\)</span>. The conformal mapping <span class="math display">\[
z=\zeta^{1 / n}=\left(\frac{w-u}{w-v}\right)^{1 / n}
\]</span> maps the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -sheeted Riemann surface onto the complex plane <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. In the case of a CFT the energy-momentum tensor (or stress-energy tensor) decomposes into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic components (see Section 7.11). The holomorphic component of the stress-energy tensor <span class="math inline">\(T(w)\)</span> under a conformal mapping transforms as (Belavin et al., 1984; Di Francesco et al., 1997 ) <span class="math display">\[
T(w)=\left(\frac{d z}{d w}\right)^{2} T(z)+\frac{c}{12}\{z, w\}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\{z, w\}=\left(z^{\prime \prime \prime} z^{\prime}-\frac{3}{2} z^{\prime \prime 2}\right) / z^{\prime 2}\)</span> is the Schwartzian derivative. However, in the plane <span class="math inline">\(\langle T(z)\rangle_{ C }=0,\)</span> since the system is rotational and translation-invariant, it follows that the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor on the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -sheeted Riemann surface is <span class="math display">\[
\langle T(w)\rangle=\frac{c}{12}\{z, w\}=\frac{c}{24}\left(1-\frac{1}{n^{2}}\right) \frac{(v-u)^{2}}{(w-u)^{2}(w-v)^{2}}
\]</span> But this should be the same as the computation of the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor in the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -sheeted Riemann surface. In particular, if the stressenergy tensor for the replicated Lagrangian is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times this answer, this leads to the result <span class="math display">\[
\frac{\left\langle T(w)^{(n)} T _{n}(u, 0) T _{n}^{-1}(v, 0)\right\rangle}{\left\langle T _{n}(u, 0) T _{n}-1(v, 0)\right\rangle}=\frac{c}{24 n}\left(n^{2}-1\right) \frac{(v-u)^{2}}{(w-u)^{2}(w-v)^{2}}
\]</span> In CFT the fields obey a set of conformal Ward identities (Belavin et al., 1984 ), which in this case take the form (Calabrese and Cardy, 2004; Calabrese et al., 2009) <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
\left\langle T(w)^{(n)} T _{n}(u, 0) T _{n}^{-1}(v, 0)\right\rangle \\
\quad=\left(\frac{1}{w-u} \partial_{u}+\frac{d_{ T _{n}}}{(w-u)^{2}}+\frac{1}{w-v} \partial_{v}+\frac{d_{ T _{n}-1}}{(w-v)^{2}}\right)\left\langle T _{n}(u, 0) T _{n}^{-1}(v, 0)\right\rangle
\end{array}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d_{ T _{n}}=d_{ T _{n}-1}\)</span> is the scaling dimension of the primary field <span class="math inline">\(T _{n}\)</span> (and of <span class="math inline">\(T _{n}^{-1}\)</span> ). Using that, by definition of the scaling dimension <span class="math display">\[
\left\langle T _{n}(u, 0) T _{n}^{-1}(v, 0)\right\rangle=\frac{1}{|u-v|^{2 d_{n}}}
\]</span> we can now identify the scaling dimension of the twist fields <span class="math inline">\(d_{n}\)</span> to be <span class="math display">\[
d_{n}=\frac{c}{12}\left(n-\frac{1}{n}\right)
\]</span> Since the partition function <span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}=\frac{Z_{n}[A]}{Z^{n}}
\]</span> is equivalent to the two-point function of the twist fields, Eq. (17.24), it should behave in the same way under conformal transformations. Hence, up to a nonuniversal constant <span class="math inline">\(C_{n}\)</span>, we can make the identification <span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}=C_{n}\left(\frac{v-u}{a}\right)^{-(c / 6)(n-1 / n)}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a short-distance cutoff. It then follows that the Rényi and von Neumann entanglement entropies obey the scaling (Holzhey et al., 1994; Calabrese and Cardy, 2004 ) <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
S_{A}^{(n)} &amp;=\frac{c}{6}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right) \ln \left(\frac{\ell}{a}\right)+\text { constant } \\
S_{A} &amp;=\frac{c}{3} \ln \left(\frac{\ell}{a}\right)+ constant
\end{aligned}
\]</span> This is the main result.</p>
<p>Calabrese and Cardy also derived expressions for the entanglement entropy for a system with finite size <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. In the case of periodic boundary conditions they found the result for a system of length <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and an interval <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> : <span class="math display">\[
S_{A}[L, \ell]=\frac{c}{3} \ln \left(\frac{L}{\pi a} \sin \left(\frac{\pi \ell}{L}\right)\right)+ constant
\]</span> Using a conformal mapping <span class="math inline">\(w \rightarrow z=(\beta /(2 \pi)) \ln w\)</span> that maps each sheet on the <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> plane onto an infinitely long cylinder of circumference <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, which plays the role of the inverse temperature, Calabrese and Cardy derived a formula for tr <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A}^{n}\)</span> in a thermally mixed state at temperature <span class="math inline">\(\beta^{-1}\)</span> resulting in an entropy <span class="math display">\[
S_{A}(T, \ell)=\frac{c}{3} \ln \left(\frac{\beta}{\pi a} \sinh \left(\frac{\pi \ell}{\beta}\right)\right)+\text { constant }
\]</span> At <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> this result reproduces the result for the entanglement entropy in a <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> conformal field theory, Eq. (17.36). It also recovers the (expected) extensive local thermodynamic entropy in the high-temperature limit <span class="math inline">\(T \gg \ell^{-1}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
S=\frac{\pi c}{3} T \ell+\cdots
\]</span> The most powerful numerical method to simulate <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> systems is, at present, the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) (White, 1992; Schollwöck, 2005 ; Hallberg, 2006 ). The geometry used in DMRG calculations is a half-line with some specified boundary condition at the endpoint. This method involves the computation of the reduced density matrix of some region <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> which we will take to be the interval <span class="math inline">\([0, \ell) .\)</span> The rest of the system is region <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> and has length <span class="math inline">\(L-\ell .\)</span> In the case of this geometry Calabrese and Cardy found the following result for the entanglement entropy of region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (Calabrese et al., 2009 ): <span class="math display">\[
S_{A}[\ell, L]=\frac{c}{6} \ln \left(\frac{2 L}{\pi a} \sin \left(\frac{\pi \ell}{L}\right)\right)+\ln g+\text { constant }
\]</span> This result provides the most direct and efficient way to compute the central charge <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> using numerical DMRG calculations. It shows that the entanglement entropy is a scaling function of <span class="math inline">\(\ell / L\)</span> with a form that allows the determination of the finite-size corrections. The constant term, <span class="math inline">\(\ln g,\)</span> is the so-called boundary entropy of Affleck and Ludwig, as discussed in Section 15.6.3, which is a universal quantity that depends only on the boundary conditions. One may object to keeping the constant term, since it is in principle non-universal. However, if two different entanglement entropies are computed using the same regularization, their difference is finite and universal. Thus, the finite universal terms are actually meaningful and universal (in this sense) up to a choice of which conformally invariant boundary condition is considered. We will see in the next sections that in space dimensions <span class="math inline">\(D&gt;1\)</span> the entanglement entropy is characterized by universal constant corrections to the non-universal area-law term.</p>
<h2 id="entanglement-entropy-in-the-quantum-lifshitz-universality-class">6 Entanglement entropy in the quantum Lifshitz universality class</h2>
<p>Very few results are known for quantum critical systems in space dimensions <span class="math inline">\(D&gt;1 .\)</span> A special case in which the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy in quantum critical systems has been studied in some detail is the quantum Lifshitz universality class, discussed in Section <span class="math inline">\(9.15,\)</span> which includes the quantum dimer model (QDM) and its generalizations, see Chapter <span class="math inline">\(9 .\)</span> The scaling of the entanglement entropy in the quantum Lifshitz universality class was discussed first by Fradkin and Moore (2006), whose work we follow here in some detail, and was further refined in Fradkin (2009), Hsu and Fradkin (2010), Hsu et al. (2009b), and Oshikawa (2010). The scaling of the entanglement entropy in the quantum critical dimer-model wave function was determined (mostly numerically) by Stéphan and collaborators (Stéphan et al., 2009,2011 ).</p>
<p>We will discuss this problem in terms of the ground-state wave function for the quantum Lifshitz model, which is given by (see Eq. (9.179)) <span class="math display">\[
\Psi_{0}[\varphi(x)]=\frac{1}{\sqrt{Z_{0}}} \exp \left(-\int d^{2} x \frac{\kappa}{2}(\vec{\nabla} \varphi(x))^{2}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> is a parameter of the quantum Lifshitz model, which is specified in Eq. <span class="math inline">\((9.161),\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z_{0}\)</span> is the norm of this wave function (see Eq. <span class="math inline">\(\left.(9.180)\right)\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
Z_{0}=\left\|\Psi_{0}\right\|^{2}=\int D \varphi \exp \left(-\int d^{2} x \kappa(\vec{\nabla} \varphi(\vec{x}))^{2}\right)
\]</span> Recall that the field <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is compactified with compactification radius <span class="math inline">\(R=1\)</span>. The quantum critical point of the Rokhsar-Kivelson QDM is represented by the choice of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=1 /(8 \pi)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The wave functions of the quantum Lifshitz universality class (and its generalization) have the special property that the weight of a field configuration <span class="math inline">\([\varphi]\)</span> in the wave function is local and has the form of the Gibbs weights in a conformally invariant classical system in two space dimensions. Consequently, the norm <span class="math inline">\(Z_{0}\)</span> of these wave functions is equivalent to a conformally invariant classical partition function in two dimensions (Ardonne et al., 2004 ).</p>
<p>Let us first consider the case in which the system is defined on a large disk of diameter <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> with some boundary conditions at infinity. We will consider the plane geometry shown in Fig. 17.3. In this case the "entangling region" will be a simply connected region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> with the topology of a disk of diameter <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> with boundary <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>. The complement of region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is region <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. The wave function has the form <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{0}\left[\varphi_{A}, \varphi_{B}\right]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\left[\varphi_{A}\right]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left[\varphi_{B}\right]\)</span> label the degrees of freedom on regions <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> respectively.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>For conformal quantum critical points, the Hilbert space has an orthonormal basis of states <span class="math inline">\(|\{\varphi\}\rangle\)</span> indexed by classical configurations <span class="math inline">\(\{\varphi\},\)</span> and the ground state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Psi_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> of the bipartite system is determined by a local CFT action <span class="math inline">\(S[\varphi]:\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
\left|\Psi_{0}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{Z_{0}}} \int D \varphi e^{-S(\{\varphi\}) / 2}|\{\varphi\}\rangle
\]</span> Here <span class="math display">\[
Z_{0}=\int D \varphi e^{-S(\{\varphi\})}
\]</span> and expectation values in this state reproduce CFT correlators. Fradkin and Moore (2006) used the "replica trick" to compute the entanglement entropy (Holzhey et al., 1994; Calabrese and Cardy, 2004) for conformally invariant wave functions, and showed that the trace of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th power of the reduced density matrix, <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A}\)</span> is the reduced density matrix of a region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> form a partition of the entire system <span class="math inline">\(A \cup B,\)</span> and are separated by their common boundary <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> ) for the ground state <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{0}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(A \cup B\)</span>, is given by <span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}=\frac{Z_{n}}{Z^{n}}
\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(Z_{n}\)</span> is the partition function of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> copies of the equivalent <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> classical statistical-mechanical system satisfying the constraint that their degrees of freedom are identified on the boundary <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Z^{n}\)</span> is the partition function for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> decoupled systems.</p>
<p>In order to construct <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n},\)</span> we need an expression for the matrix elements of the reduced density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle\varphi^{A}\left|\rho_{A}\right| \varphi^{\prime A}\right\rangle .\)</span> Since the ground-state wave function is a local function of the field <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(x),\)</span> a general matrix element of the reduced density matrix is a trace of the density matrix of the pure state <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{ GS }[\varphi]\)</span> over the degrees of freedom of the "unobserved" region <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\varphi^{B}(x)\)</span>. Hence the matrix elements of <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A}\)</span> take the form <span class="math display">\[
\left\langle\varphi^{A}\left|\hat{\rho}_{A}\right| \varphi^{\prime A}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{Z} \int\left[D \varphi^{B}\right] \exp \left[-\left(\frac{1}{2} S^{A}\left(\varphi^{A}\right)+\frac{1}{2} S^{A}\left(\varphi^{\prime A}\right)+S^{B}\left(\varphi^{B}\right)\right)\right]
\]</span> where the degrees of freedom satisfy the boundary condition at the common boundary <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma:\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
B C_{\Gamma}:\left.\varphi^{B}\right|_{\Gamma}=\left.\varphi^{A}\right|_{\Gamma}=\left.\varphi^{\prime A}\right|_{\Gamma}
\]</span> Proceeding with the computation of <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n},\)</span> one immediately sees that the matrix product requires the condition <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{i}^{A}=\varphi_{i-1}^{\prime A}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i=1, \ldots, n,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{n}^{\prime A}=\varphi_{1}^{A}\)</span> from the trace condition. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}\)</span> takes the form</p>
