<p>摘要-2</p>
<p>We introduce a novel class of phase transitions separating quantum states with different <strong>entanglement features</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An example of such an "entanglement phase transition" is provided by the <strong>many-body localization</strong> transition in disordered quantum systems, as it separates highly entangled thermal states at weak disorder from many-body localized states with low entanglement at strong disorder.
<ul>
<li>(thermal states) highly entangled <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> weak disorder</li>
<li>(many-body localized states ) low entanglement <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> strong disorder</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the <strong>spirit of</strong> random matrix theory, we describe a simple model for such transitions where a physical quantum many-body system <strong>lives at the "holographic"</strong> boundary of a bulk random tensor network.</li>
<li>Using a replica trick approach, we <strong>map</strong> the calculation of the entanglement properties of the boundary system onto the free energy cost of fluctuating domain walls in a classical statistical mechanics model.</li>
<li>This allows us to <strong>interpret</strong> transitions between volume-law and area-law scaling of entanglement as <strong>ordering transitions</strong> in this statistical mechanics model.</li>
<li>Our approach allows us to get an <strong>analytic handle on</strong> the field theory of these entanglement transitions.</li>

<h2 id="介绍">1 介绍</h2>
<p>量子纠缠在非平衡态中的重要作用的早期例子</p>
<ul>
<li>基态 <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> 面积律<br />
</li>
<li>激法态 <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> 体积律</li>
</ul>
<p>Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in our understanding of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and the process of thermalization. This can be <strong>traced back to</strong> the fact that quantum and thermal eigenstates differ dramatically in their entanglement properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>In particular, whereas quantum <strong>ground states</strong> of gapped systems with local interactions exhibit <strong>area-law</strong> scaling <span class="math inline">\([1-4]\)</span> with entanglement entropy of a subsystem proportional to its surface area,</li>
<li>typical (<strong>highly-excited</strong>) eigenstates exhibit <strong>volume law</strong> behavior, with entanglement of a subsystem scaling extensively with its volume <span class="math inline">\([5-8]\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>直觉上“越纠缠，越量子”。和直觉相反，极端纠缠的态，其实展示的是经典的动力学和关联。为什么呢？</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>体积律纠缠意味着：所有局域自由度和整个系统纠缠，所以量子信息在整个系统传播，局域观测是行不通的。</li>
<li>所以高纠缠本征态，可以用的是经典的流体力学和热性质，也就是可以用统计力学有效描述。</li>
<li>这就对本征态热化假说(ETH) 很必要，因为(ETH) 讲的是多体量子系统典型特征态中的一个小子系统的降密度矩阵实际上是热化的</li>
<li>这意味着小子系统的纠缠熵与热力学熵相吻合，因此是广泛的<span class="math inline">\(-\)</span>即满足体积定律尺度。</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast to basic intuition that states with more entanglement are "more quantum", extremely entangled states (such as volume-law entangled states) actually exhibit classical dynamics and correlations.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Volume-law entanglement implies that every piece of local degree of freedom is highly entangled with the rest of the system, such that most quantum information is scrambled among the whole system and therefore inaccessible to local observables <span class="math inline">\([5,9-12] .\)</span></li>
<li>For such highly-entangled eigenstates, only classical hydrodynamic and thermodynamic properties are accessible, which are effectively described by statistical mechanics.</li>
<li>This is the essence of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis [13,14] (ETH) which states that the reduced density matrix of a small subsystem in a typical eigenstate of a many-body quantum system is effectively thermal.</li>
<li>This implies that the entanglement entropy of small subsystems coincide with the thermodynamic entropy, and is therefore extensive <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> i.e. satisfies a volume-law scaling.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="相变多体局域化vs热化">相变：多体局域化vs热化</h4>
<p>然而，并不是所有孤立的量子多体系统都会热化。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>在强无序的情况下，会发生多体局域化（MBL），受激的特征态会违反ETH，并表现出面积律纠缠。</li>
<li>由于纠缠的形成受到强无序的阻碍，MBL系统不会弛豫到热平衡，局部量子信息可以很长时间地相干保存。</li>
<li>因此，MBL系统的高激发特征态具有与量子基态相同的面积律纠缠</li>
<li>这就为远离热平衡的、"热 "量子系统中的量子相干现象打开了大门，包括
<ul>
<li>对称性破坏秩序</li>
<li>拓扑秩序</li>
<li>甚至是量子临界现象</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>However, not all isolated quantum many-body systems thermalize.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the presence of strong disorder, manybody localization (MBL) can occur, where the excited eigenstates can violate the ETH and exhibit the arealaw entanglement [15].</li>
<li>As entanglement formation is obstructed by the strong disorder, an MBL system does not relax to thermal equilibrium, and local quantum information can be preserved coherently for a very long time.</li>
<li>Highly excited eigenstates of MBL systems therefore have the same area-law entanglement as quantum ground states, opening the door to quantum coherent phenomena in dense, "hot" quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium, including symmetry-breaking order, topological order, or even quantum criticality <span class="math inline">\([16-25]\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>多体局域化MBL导致了一个全新的动力学相变</p>
<ul>
<li>相变：thermalizing systems <span class="math inline">\(\leftrightarrow\)</span> many-body localized systems</li>
<li>thermalizing systems <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> 长时间之后热平衡 <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> volume-law <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> 经典统计相变</li>
<li>many-body localized systems <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> 长时间之后都不能热平衡 <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> area-law <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> 量子相变</li>
</ul>
<p>MBL leads to an entirely new class of dynamical phase transition <span class="math inline">\([26-30]\)</span> between thermalizing systems, whose long time behavior is described by equilibrium statistical mechanics, and many-body localized systems, which fail to reach thermal equilibrium even at very long times. While conventional phase transitions separate phases with similar entanglement properties - with area-law scaling for quantum phase transitions and volume-law scaling for thermal phase transitions, the MBL transition is special in that it is a transition of the entanglement properties of many-body eigenstates, across which the entanglement scaling changes dramatically from the area-law (in the MBL phase) to the volume-law (in the ETH phase). It is also a transition at which the quantum mechanics description is taken over by the (classical) statistical mechanics description, i.e. a transition between quantum and classical phases, which lies beyond the traditional framework of phase transitions. Most of our current understanding of its universal properties relies on small scale numerics <span class="math inline">\([30-34]\)</span> and phenomenological renormalization group approaches <span class="math inline">\([35-41] .\)</span> More broadly, many <strong>fundamental questions</strong> remain:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>how does the singular entanglement rearrangement occur at the transition?</li>
<li>Is the MBL transition the only example of such entanglement transition?</li>
<li>Are there other examples of dynamical - neither quantum nor classical - transitions that separate quantum states with entanglement properties intermediate between MBL and thermal systems (say with power-law scaling)?</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="全息描述纠缠结构">全息描述纠缠结构</h4>
<p>为了解决这些问题，结合从随机矩阵理论(random matrix)中得到的启发，我们在本文中提出采用 "全息描述"，对量子态的纠缠结构进行描述。</p>
<ul>
<li>介绍holographic duality全息对偶</li>
<li>holographic duality在纠缠相变中的应用</li>
<li>全息张量网络tensor network holography领域的发展应用到纠缠相变</li>
</ul>
<p>To address these questions, we propose in this paper to adopt a "holographic description" of the entanglement structure of quantum states combined with ideas inspired from <strong>random matrix theory</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The holographic duality was originally proposed <span class="math inline">\([42-44]\)</span> as a duality between a quantum field theory and a gravitational theory in one higher dimension. More generally, it is a duality between the entanglement structure of a quantum many-body system on the holographic boundary and the spacetime structure of a gravitational system in the holographic bulk <span class="math inline">\([45-\)</span> 64]. The idea is manifested in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula [46] which relates the entanglement entropy of a boundary region to the area of the minimal surface in the bulk that is homologous to the same region.</li>
<li>Using this connection, area-law entanglement corresponds to a shallow holographic bulk with the infrared region capped off, whereas volume-law entanglement typically arises when there is a black hole in the holographic bulk <span class="math inline">\([53,65] .\)</span> This suggests that entanglement transitions (like the MBL transition) in the quantum many-body system may be <strong>viewed as transitions</strong> of the holographic bulk geometry in the gravitational dual description [66]. In this regard, going one dimension higher into the holographic bulk may provide new insights into the MBL transition. The main goal of this work is to explore one possibility of such holographic description for entanglement transitions using recent developments in the field of <strong>tensor network holography</strong> <span class="math inline">\([47-49,57,58]\)</span>.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<p>The physical degrees of freedom live on the boundary of the network (represented by the un-contracted dangling legs). The tensor contractions result in a complex number that describes the many-body wave function for the physical system. The bulk tensors are introduced as hidden variables, which are necessary to capture the complicated multibody entanglement in the many-body state. The tensor <strong>network geometry</strong> depends on the entanglement structure of the boundary quantum state:</p>
<ul>
<li>for area-law entangled states, one could use linear (or quasi-linear) graphs (with no or little bulk layers) like Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1(\)</span> a) , reducing the tensor network to <strong>matrix product states (MPS)</strong> routinely used in DMRG simulations [70];</li>
<li>whereas <strong>critical</strong> states with <strong>logarithmic entanglement</strong> require a more involved tree-like hyperbolic bulk structure called MERA <span class="math inline">\([71,72],\)</span> similar to Fig. 1(b). There are procedures to efficiently construct explicit tensor network representations for MBL (or marginal MBL) states <span class="math inline">\([66,73-78] .\)</span></li>
<li>However, for volume-law entangled states on the ETH side, the holographic tensor network would involve a densely connected subgraph (or even just a big random tensor) as in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1( c )\)</span> to represent a black hole state. Currently, there is no numerically efficient method to manipulate tensor contractions on such networks. This renders the exact computation of the ETH state unaffordable for large sized systems, which also hinders the study of MBL transition that is adjacent to the ETH phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>在热态的系综上提取诸如纠缠或流体力学等属性的统计数据，可能不需要获得精确的多体波函数的完整结构。这样的思想在量子混沌理论的发展中就有其概念根源。这一理念在最近的一些研究中得到了充分的发挥。</p>
<p>On the other hand, extracting statistics of properties such as entanglement or hydrodynamics over the ensemble of thermal states may not require having access to the full structure of exact many-body wave functions. Such an idea has its conceptual roots in the development of the quantum chaos theory in terms of random matrices [79], where thermal states were simply modeled by random states (or random tensors in the tensor network language), and this philosophy has been exploited in several recent works to study entanglement dynamics and hydrodynamics in random quantum circuit evolutions <span class="math inline">\([80-87]\)</span></p>

<p>In this work, we explore the structure of entanglement, in a refined version of the random matrix ansatz, where instead of a big fully connected bulk tensor,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>we consider a structured bulk network of locally connected tensors, in which each tensor is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution, producing an ensemble of random tensor network (RTN) states, as proposed by <span class="math inline">\([65,88,89] .\)</span></li>
<li>We will develop a new approach to these RTN states that enables a rare analytic handle on their entanglement properties.</li>
<li>Further, in analogy to the black hole no hair theorem [9093], that the area of the black hole is proportional to its entropy and is independent from details of its initial state, we focus on the statistics of entanglement entropies rather than detailed structure of the entanglement spectrum and eigenstates (Schmidt states). The RTN wavefunctions we consider are exactly the type of "bald" networks, average over random tensors effectively removes all features in the many-body state that are not invariant under local unitaries, leaving only the entanglement features encoded in the network structure.</li>

<p>引入一个技巧来摆脱限制，探索任意键维的随机张量网络的物理，以探索体积和面积定律状态。在全息语言中，这相当于在体几何的经典引力描述之外加入了量子效应。</p>

This quantity was computed in the limit of strictly infinite bond dimension in Ref. <span class="math inline">\([65],\)</span> corresponding to maximally entangled states (deep in the thermal phase). Building on these results, we will introduce a generalized replica trick to move away from this restrictive limit, and explore the physics of random tensor networks at arbitrary bond-dimension to explore both volume and area-law states. In the holographic language, this corresponds to incorporating quantum effects beyond the classical gravity description of the bulk geometry. This allows us to access a quantum regime where the RyuTakayanagi formula breaks down.</p>

<p>In particular, we show that the entanglement entropy (and all Rényi entropies <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{m}\)</span> ) averaged over all possible random tensor realizations can be computed for any bond dimension by using a generalized replica trick and mapping the entanglement calculation onto a classical spin model defined on the graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. In that language, we can interpret the quantum entanglement entropy of the boundary physical system as the free-energy cost of a boundary domain in the classical spin model. By tuning the bond dimension of the random tensor networks, this construction allows us to identify an entanglement transition of the quantum wave function as the paramagneticto-ferromagnetic transition in the classical spin model. This gives us an analytic handle on the universal properties and the scaling of entanglement at the critical point, and provides the first field theory formulation of such entanglement transitions. By considering the graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> to be random, we uncover a new dynamical transition separating phases with area-law and power-law scaling of entanglement. The universal properties of these entanglement transitions can be described using a certain conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge <span class="math inline">\(c=0\)</span> coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity, leading to exact relations for the critical exponents.</p>

</ul>
<p>To establish notation, we briefly review the projected entangled pair states (PEPS) [94] construction of a random tensor network [65]. Consider a quantum system (henceforth called the physical system) whose Hilbert space is a product of on-site Hilbert spaces: <span class="math display">\[
H_{p h y}=\otimes_{i \in p h y} H_{i}
\]</span> For convenience, we consider each <span class="math inline">\(H _{i}\)</span> to be of fixed dimension, <span class="math inline">\(D_{p}\)</span> (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(D_{p}=2\)</span> for a spin-1/2 Hilbert space).</p>
<p>A PEPS wave-function can be constructed by augmenting the physical space by auxiliary quantum degrees of freedom (DOF) defined on a graph (network) <span class="math display">\[
G=(V, E)
\]</span> with</p>
<ul>
<li>vertices (sites) <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span></li>
<li>edges (bonds) <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will refer to the auxiliary DOF as the "bulk", marked out by the blue region in Fig. 2.</p>

<p>The physical DOF are then assigned to dangling ends on the boundary of the graph <span class="math inline">\(G,\)</span> represented by the small black dots in Fig. 2. For each pair <span class="math inline">\((v, e)\)</span> of site <span class="math inline">\(v \in V\)</span> and its adjacent bond <span class="math inline">\(e \in E,\)</span> we define an associated Hilbert space <span class="math display">\[
H _{v e}
\]</span> of dimension <span class="math inline">\(D_{e},\)</span> which can be spanned by a set of basis states <span class="math inline">\(\left|\mu_{v e}\right\rangle\)</span> labeled by <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{v e}=1,2, \cdots, D_{e} .\)</span> In the tensor network language, <span class="math inline">\(D_{e}\)</span> is the bond dimension specific to each bond <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="体内格点态">体内格点态</h4>
<p>On each bulk site <span class="math inline">\(v \in V\)</span>, i.e. each small black circle in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2,\)</span> we define a state (the site state) <span class="math display">\[
\left|T_{v}\right\rangle=\sum_{\left\{\mu_{v e_{i}}\right\}}\left(T_{v}\right)_{\mu_{v e_{1}} \cdots \mu_{v e_{z}}}\left|\mu_{v e_{1}}\right\rangle \cdots\left|\mu_{v e_{z}}\right\rangle
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(e_{i}(i=1, \cdots, z)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{v e_{i}}\)</span> denote the bonds emanating from the site <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</li>
<li>The number of adjacent bonds of a site (the degree of the vertex) is denoted as the coordination number <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> of that site.</li>
<li>Each site state <span class="math inline">\(\left|T_{v}\right\rangle\)</span> is specified by a set of coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\left(T_{v}\right)_{\mu_{v e_{1}} \cdots \mu_{v e_{z}}},\)</span> which can be further arranged into a tensor <span class="math inline">\(T_{v}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore each bulk site <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> represents a tensor <span class="math inline">\(T_{v}\)</span> in the tensor network. A special subset of vertices on the boundary of the graph (small black dots in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2( a )\)</span> ) are taken to be the physical DOF, on which the physical Hilbert spaces <span class="math inline">\(H _{i}\)</span> are defined. These boundary vertices are dangling. No site states are defined on them.</p>
<h4 id="bond-边态">bond 边态</h4>
<p>On each bond <span class="math inline">\(e \in E,\)</span> i.e. each link in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2( a ),\)</span> we define an entangled pair state <span class="math inline">\(\left|I_{e}\right\rangle\)</span> (the bond state), <span class="math display">\[
\left|I_{e}\right\rangle=\sum_{\mu_{v e}, \mu_{v^{\prime} e}=1}^{D_{e}} \lambda_{\mu_{v e} \mu_{v^{\prime} e}}\left|\mu_{v e}\right\rangle\left|\mu_{v^{\prime} e}\right\rangle
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v^{\prime}\)</span> denote the two sites linked by the bond e.</li>
<li>Let us treat the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{\mu_{v e} \mu_{v^{\prime}} e}\)</span> as a matrix and define the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th Renyi mutual information across the bond <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> as</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I_{e}^{(n)}=\frac{2}{1-n} \log \operatorname{Tr}\left(\lambda \lambda^{\dagger}\right)^{n}
\]</span> The entangled pair state <span class="math inline">\(\left|I_{e}\right\rangle\)</span> across the bond <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is then characterized by the set of values of the bond mutual information <span class="math inline">\(I_{e}^{(n)}\)</span>, which can change continuously from 0 to <span class="math inline">\(2 \log D_{e}\)</span> in general. The maximal mutual information <span class="math inline">\(I_{e}^{(n)}=2 \log D_{e}\)</span> can be achieved if the state <span class="math inline">\(\left|I_{e}\right\rangle\)</span> is maximally entangled, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{\mu_{v e} \mu_{v^{\prime} e}}=D_{e}^{-1 / 2} \delta_{\mu_{v e} \mu_{v^{\prime} e}} .\)</span> However, considering more general (and less entangled) states <span class="math inline">\(\left|I_{e}\right\rangle\)</span> allows us to treat <span class="math inline">\(I_{e}^{(n)}\)</span> as <strong>continuously tunable parameters</strong> (rather than discretely tuned by <span class="math inline">\(\left.D_{e}\right)\)</span>, which can be used to control the entanglement properties of the PEPS wave-function and to drive the entanglement transition. Finally, we will always assume that the boundary vertices are connected to the bulk vertices by maximally entangled states with fixed bond mutual information <span class="math inline">\(2 \log D_{p}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="投影纠缠配对态">投影纠缠配对态</h4>
<p>With <span class="math inline">\(\left|T_{v}\right\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left|I_{e}\right\rangle\)</span> defined above, the final step is to project the bulk states <span class="math inline">\(|T\rangle=\otimes_{v \in V}\left|T_{v}\right\rangle\)</span> onto the entangled pair states on the bonds of the graph, <span class="math display">\[
|\psi[T]\rangle=\bigotimes_{v \in V} \bigotimes_{e \in E}\left\langle T_{v} \mid I_{e}\right\rangle .
\]</span> The remaining boundary vertices that are not touched by the projection will provide the physical degrees of freedom, on which the PEPS wave-function <span class="math inline">\(|\psi[T]\rangle\)</span> is supported. Equivalently, we may work with the density matrix: <span class="math display">\[
\rho[T]=|\psi[T]\rangle\langle\psi[T]| .
\]</span> As a mock-up of wave-functions for complicated, disordered, and interacting quantum systems, in this work, we will study the entanglement properties of random PEPS states, or random tensor network (RTN) states, obtained by drawing the tensor <span class="math inline">\(T_{v}\)</span> for each site <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> independently from a featureless Gaussian distribution characterized by zero mean, <span class="math inline">\(\overline{T_{v}}=0,\)</span> and variance: <span class="math display">\[
\overline{\left(T_{v}^{*}\right)_{\mu_{1} \ldots \mu_{z}}\left(T_{v}\right)_{\nu_{1} \ldots \nu_{z}}}=\delta_{\mu_{1}, \nu_{1}} \ldots \delta_{\mu_{z}, \nu_{z}}
\]</span> Importantly, we note that the random PEPS states, as defined, are unnormalized. Hence, to properly compute disorder averaged quantities we will need to explicitly normalize these wave-functions before computing disorder averages. This normalization issue will be a key technical challenge in what follows, and its resolution will present our primary departure from the work of Hayden et al <span class="math inline">\([65],\)</span> which allows us to explore phase transitions in the entanglement structure of PEPS wave-functions.</p>
<h3 id="entanglement-of-random-peps">Entanglement of Random PEPs</h3>
<p>上一节定义了态PEPs，接下来是计算这个态的纠缠</p>
<p>We would like to compute the entanglement of a region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of the physical system in the random PEPs state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi[T]\rangle,\)</span> measured in terms of the tensor-averaged Renyi entropies <span class="math display">\[
S_{A}^{(n)}[T]=\frac{1}{1-n} \log \left(\frac{\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}}{(\operatorname{tr} \rho)^{n}}\right)
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\overline{(\cdots)}\)</span> refers to averaging over random tensors;</li>
<li>we define here <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A} \equiv \operatorname{tr}_{\bar{A}} \rho,\)</span> Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2( a )\)</span> and we have explicitly divided by tr <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> to ensure the normalization of the random PEPs density matrix for each realization of disorder.</li>
</ul>
<p>在极限下，log和极限可以对换</p>
<p>In Ref. [65], the tensor-average was performed in the limit of large bond dimension <span class="math inline">\(D_{e} \rightarrow \infty,\)</span> where the averages of the logarithms could be replaced by logarithms of the averages, i.e.: <span class="math display">\[
\lim _{D_{e} \rightarrow \infty} S_{A}^{(n)}[T]=\frac{1}{1-n}\left[\log \overline{\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}}-\log \overline{\operatorname{tr} \rho^{\otimes n}}\right]
\]</span> However, exchanging of the order of tensor-averaging and taking the logarithm works only in the limit of infinite bond dimension. In fact, Hayden et al. estimate that these expressions are valid only if the bond dimension diverges as a power <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in the physical system size, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> : <span class="math inline">\(D_{e} \gg L^{p}[65],\)</span> such that these expressions do not extend sensibly to thermodynamically large systems.</p>
<p>我们想把这些结果推广到有限键维的物理区域</p>
<p>We would like to extend these results to the physically reasonable regime of finite bond dimension, and in particular to examine the limits of validity in the conjectured correspondence between random tensor networks [65] and the geometric Ryu-Takayanagi formula for entanglement [46], and to access a phase transition in the entanglement structure of these RTNs between area and volume law entanglement scaling. To this end, we introduce a replica trick to properly average over random tensors for arbitrary bond-dimension. Namely, we consider taking <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> fictitious copies, or "replicas" of the system. The Renyi entropies for a generic (unnormalized) random PEPs state can then be written as: <span class="math display">\[
S_{A}^{(n)}=\left(\frac{1}{1-n}\right) \lim _{m \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{m}\left[\overline{\left(\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}\right)^{m}}-\overline{\left(\operatorname{tr} \rho^{n}\right)^{m}}\right]
\]</span> Crucially, this formulation <strong>works for</strong> arbitrary random PEPs states, without any assumption on geometry, dimensionality, tensor structure, or bond dimension.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using this replica formulation, we will confirm that the infinite bond dimension results describe the physical properties of RTNs above a critical bond dimension <span class="math inline">\(D_{c}\)</span>,</li>
<li>but qualitatively break down for <span class="math inline">\(D_{e}&lt;D_{c}\)</span>, leading to an eigenstate phase transition and a breakdown of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula [46] and the corresponding connections to dual theories of gravity.</li>

<p>Then, to obtain a non-zero contribution to <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\rho^{\otimes Q}},\)</span> we must Wick-contract each tensor for each vertex in <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> with a complex conjugated counterpart in one of the replica copies of <span class="math inline">\(\langle\psi| .\)</span> The set of possible contractions can be labeled by a permutation group element of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> copies for each vertex, <span class="math inline">\(g_{v} \in S_{Q},\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[
\overline{\rho^{\otimes Q}}=\sum_{\left\{g_{v}\right\}} w\left(\left\{g_{v}\right\}\right)
\]</span> for some weight function <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> (Fig. 4).</p>
<h4 id="weight-function的基本结构">weight function的基本结构</h4>
<p>General structure of <span class="math inline">\(w-\)</span> Before working out the full expression for <span class="math inline">\(w,\)</span> we deduce some general features.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is positive definite.</li>
<li>权函数在左乘和右乘下都是不变的，因此，自旋模型的对称群为 <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q} \times S_{Q}\)</span>. Next, since left- or rightmultiplication of all <span class="math inline">\(g_{i}\)</span> by the same permutation element <span class="math inline">\(h \in S_{Q}\)</span> is simply a re-ordering of the identical factors of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{\otimes Q},\)</span> the weight function is invariant under both left- and right- multiplication by <span class="math inline">\(h .\)</span> Hence, the symmetry group of the spin model will be <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q} \times S_{Q}\)</span>.</li>
<li>权重应该分解成<strong>成对</strong>权重的乘积 Furthermore, since, in our class of tensor network wavefunctions, the tensors on two vertices are only connected if they share a common bond, the weight should factorize into a product of pairwise weights, which we are free to write in the Boltzmann form:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
w\left(\left\{g_{v}\right\}\right) \equiv e^{-\sum_{\left\langle v v^{\prime}\right\rangle} H_{v v^{\prime}}\left(g_{v}^{-1} g_{v^{\prime}}\right)} .
\]</span></p>
<p>From these general considerations we immediately see that the <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{\otimes Q}\)</span> takes the form of the partition function of a classical spin model with spins taking values in the permutation group <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(Q=n m\)</span> elements on each vertex of the tensor network. <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{\otimes Q}\)</span> 有经典自旋模型的配分函数形式</p>
<h4 id="weight-function的具体表达">weight function的具体表达</h4>
<p>Explicit form of <span class="math inline">\(w-\)</span> Given the general structure above, we can work out the explicit form of <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. Because <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> can be factorized as a product over bonds as follows <span class="math display">\[
w\left(\left\{g_{v}\right\}\right)=\prod_{\left\langle v v^{\prime}\right\rangle} w_{\left\langle v v^{\prime}\right\rangle}\left(g_{v}^{-1} g_{v^{\prime}}\right)
\]</span> 我们只需要关注一个特定的键。we only need to focus on one particular bond.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let us consider the bond <span class="math inline">\(e=\langle 12\rangle\)</span> linking the sites 1 and 2 in the network.</li>
<li>We will first consider the bond state <span class="math inline">\(\left|I_{e}\right\rangle\)</span> to be maximally entangled.</li>
<li>Let us label the auxiliary Hilbert spaces for replica <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> on bond <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> by a basis of states <span class="math inline">\(\left|\mu_{1}^{a}, \mu_{2}^{a}\right\rangle\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{1} \in\left\{1 \ldots D_{e}\right\},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a=1 \ldots Q\)</span> is a replica index.</li>
</ol>
<p>让我们算出一组特定的维克收缩的权重，以平均随机张量。Let us work out the weight of a specific set of Wick contractions for averaging the random tensors.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Contracting a "bra" tensor for site 1 from replica <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> with a "ket" tensor in replica <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> forces the indices <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{1}^{a}=\mu_{1}^{b}\)</span> for all bonds emanating from site 1.</li>
<li>Moreover, performing the projection to the maximally entangled pair on a bond forces the indices for the tensors on both ends of that bond to coincide.</li>
<li>Then, all possible configurations are summed over, and the weight is given by the number of states satisfying these two constraints.</li>
<li>Due to the symmetry under left- and right- multiplication, <span class="math inline">\(g_{v} \rightarrow g_{v} h_{R}, g_{v^{\prime}} \rightarrow g_{v^{\prime}} h_{R}\)</span> without loss of generality, we may take <span class="math inline">\(g_{1}=1\)</span>, and consider arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(g_{2}\)</span>.</li>
<li>We can write <span class="math inline">\(g_{2}\)</span> in cycle-notation, e.g. when <span class="math inline">\(Q=5\)</span>, the permutation (134)(25) cyclically permutes <span class="math inline">\(1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(2 \leftrightarrow 5\)</span>. The joint effect of contractions for the tensors <span class="math inline">\(T_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{2}\)</span> at the two sites 1 and 2 , along with the entangled pair projection at the bond <span class="math inline">\(e=(12)\)</span> linking these two sites, constrains the indices <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{a}\)</span> to coincide for all auxiliary DOF within each cycle. Hence, the number of states for this contraction is equal to <span class="math inline">\(D_{e}^{C\left(g_{2}\right)},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(C(g)\)</span> is the number of distinct cycles in <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(C(g)=2\)</span> for the above example, <span class="math inline">\(g=(134)(25))\)</span>. For general <span class="math inline">\(g_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_{2},\)</span> this shows that the weight is</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
w_{e}\left(g_{1}^{-1} g_{2}\right) \propto D_{e}^{C\left(g_{1}^{-1} g_{2}\right)}=e^{J_{e} C\left(g_{1}^{-1} g_{2}\right)}
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(J_{e}=\log D_{e}\)</span> as claimed previously. If we further consider the bond state to be a generic entangled pair state <span class="math inline">\(\left|I_{e}\right\rangle\)</span> from Eq. 2 above, the weight <span class="math inline">\(w_{e}\)</span> on the bond <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> will be generalized to <span class="math display">\[
w_{e}(g)=\prod_{\alpha=1}^{C(g)} \operatorname{tr}\left(\lambda \lambda^{\dagger}\right)^{l_{g}^{\alpha}}=\prod_{\alpha=1}^{C(g)} \exp \left(\frac{1-l_{g}^{\alpha}}{2} I_{e}^{\left(l_{g}^{\alpha}\right)}\right)
\]</span> in terms of the values of the bond mutual information <span class="math inline">\(I_{e}^{(n)}\)</span> defined in Eq. 3. So the energy function <span class="math inline">\(H_{e}\)</span> can be read out from the Boltzmann form <span class="math inline">\(w_{\langle 12\rangle}=e^{-H_{\langle 12\rangle}\left(g_{1}^{-1} g_{2}\right)}\)</span>, and the result was given by Eq. 12. In general, <span class="math inline">\(H_{e}\)</span> is continuously tunable by the bond mutual information [95], which provides us the flexibility to drive the RTN state through the entanglement transition.</p>
<h4 id="边界条件">边界条件</h4>
<p>到目前为止，我们一直在考虑将张量网络的bulk映射到一个经典的置换自旋模型。正确确定边界条件也很重要</p>
<p>Boundary conditions: So far, we have been considering the mapping of the bulk of the tensor network to a classical permutation-spin model. It is also important to properly fix the boundary conditions to perform the appropriate contraction of the <span class="math inline">\(n \times m\)</span> replicas of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>. Consider computing the entanglement entropy of a physical (boundary) region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. To apply Eq. 9 , we can first consider <span class="math inline">\(n m\)</span> copies of the system's density matrix: <span class="math inline">\(\otimes^{n m} \rho\)</span>. Let us group these <span class="math inline">\(n m\)</span> factors of <span class="math inline">\(\rho,\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> groups of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and order the factors in each group from <span class="math inline">\(1 \ldots n .\)</span> Each copy of the density matrix, reads: <span class="math inline">\(\rho=|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> is the PEPS wave-function of the network, i.e. contains a vector ("ket", <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> ) with tensors <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> and a dual vector ("bra", <span class="math inline">\(\langle\psi|)\)</span> with conjugated tensors <span class="math inline">\(T^{*}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To compute the second term, <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}^{(n m)}=\overline{\left(\operatorname{tr} \rho^{n}\right)^{m}},\)</span> in Eq. <span class="math inline">\(9,\)</span> one contracts within each group of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> copies of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> all of the physical (boundary) legs of the vector ("ket") of the <span class="math inline">\(j^{\text {th }}\)</span> copy of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> to those of the dual vector ("bra") in the <span class="math inline">\(((j+1) \bmod n)^{\text {th }}\)</span> copy (see Fig. 5).</p>

Boundary conditions <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> Schematic representation of boundary conditions in the entanglement region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (left-panel) and in its complement, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A},\)</span> (right-panel) for the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\left(\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}\right)^{m}\)</span> the case of <span class="math inline">\(n=3, m=2\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast, to compute the first term <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}^{(n m)}=\overline{\left(\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}\right)^{m}}\)</span> involving the reduced density matrix of <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> one should contract the physical legs inside <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as for <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}^{(n m)},\)</span> but, to trace out <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A},\)</span> one should connect the physical legs of the "ket"-tensors in the <span class="math inline">\(j^{\text {th }}\)</span> copy to those of the "bra"-tensors in the same copy (Fig. 5).</p>
<p>In other words, in the complement <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span> of the entanglement region, the boundary tensors in <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}^{(n m)}\)</span> are contracted within each copy of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, without permutation, corresponding to a trivial (identity) permutation between the "bra" and "ket" factors of <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{\otimes n m}\)</span>. In contrast, the pattern of contractions in <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}^{(n m)}\)</span> inside the entanglement region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> corresponds to a non-trivial permutation element that cyclically permutes the "bra" and "ket" factors within each of the <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> factors of <span class="math inline">\(\rho^{\otimes n}\)</span>. We denote this permutation (as it is convention) by <span class="math inline">\(g_{ SWAP } \in S_{n m}\)</span> which will play a special role in what follows (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the boundary tensors in <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}^{(n m)}\)</span> are contracted with a fixed (arbitrary) permutation everywhere at the boundary, which can be chosen by symmetry to be the identity since <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is pure, corresponding to writing <span class="math display">\[
Z _{0}^{(n m)}=\overline{(\operatorname{tr} \rho)^{n m}}
\]</span> Once the boundary contractions have been performed, one can average over the random tensors, resulting in a Wick contraction of each "ket" tensor <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in one copy, <span class="math inline">\(j \in 1, \ldots, n m,\)</span> with the "bra" tensor, <span class="math inline">\(T^{*}\)</span> of another copy <span class="math inline">\(g(j)\)</span> as described above, resulting in a classical spin model with spins defined by the permutation <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> for each tensor, as described above.</p>
<p>The fixed boundary conditions for the physical tensor legs give a larger weight (in the random-tensor average), when the permutation group element corresponding to the Wick-contraction of the boundary tensors in the tensor-averaging matches the permutation group element characterizing the contractions in <span class="math inline">\(\left(\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}\right)^{m}\)</span> (either <span class="math inline">\(g_{v}=g_{\text {SWAP }}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(v \in A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(g_{v}=1\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(v \in \bar{A}\)</span> ). This effect can be captured by a boundary "field" that breaks the permutation symmetry, described by a Hamiltonian: <span class="math display">\[
H_{ bdry }=-\sum_{v \in A} h_{v} C\left(g_{ SWAP }^{-1} g_{v}\right)-\sum_{v \in \bar{A}} h_{v} C\left(g_{v}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(h_{v}=\log D_{p}\)</span> is the log of the physical onsite Hilbert space dimension.</p>
<h3 id="physical-picture">Physical Picture</h3>
<p>In the spin-model, the different boundary fields in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span>, effectively "twist" the boundary spins from <span class="math inline">\(g_{\text {SWAP }}\)</span> (in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> ) to <span class="math inline">\(1(\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span> ). If the boundary spins follow this field then, this twist introduces an extra spin domain wall terminating at the ends of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (for a <span class="math inline">\(d=2\)</span> -dimensional bulk network, or more generally at the boundary of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in a general network of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> bulk dimensions). Thus,</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}^{(n m)}\)</span> represents the partition function of the spin model with twisted boundary conditions leading to an extra spin domain</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}^{(n m)}\)</span> represents the partition function with uniform <span class="math inline">\(g=1\)</span> at the boundary</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text { The difference: } \Delta F^{(n m)}=-\left(\log Z _{A}^{(n m)}-\log Z _{0}^{(n m)}\right),
\]</span> then represents the free-energy cost of the extra boundary domain (region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> ). We further note that, in the replica limit, <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0, \Delta F^{(n m)}\)</span> reduces to Eq. 9 (the extra logarithm in the free energy is automatically produced by the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0\)</span> ).</p>
<p>因此，我们可以将PEPS波函数的量子纠缠熵——解释为经典自旋模型中边界域的自由能成本。</p>
<p><strong>Hence, we may interpret the quantum entanglement entropy of the PEPS wavefunction as the free-energy cost of a boundary domain in the classical spin model.</strong></p>
<p>Before analyzing the model in detail, let us briefly comment on the expected behavior in various limits.</p>
<h4 id="极限大bond">极限：大bond</h4>
<p>At large bond-dimension, we expect an ordered (magnetic) phase of the spin model. Here, there are two cases.</p>
<p>First, if the boundary field is weaker than the bulk spin order (i.e. if the logarithm of the bulk bond dimension times the number of nearest neighbors for each boundary spin exceeds the logarithm of the physical on-site Hilbert space dimension), the system will ignore the boundary field and order to <span class="math inline">\(g=1\)</span> everywhere. Ignoring the boundary field inside <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> will cost an extensive amount of energy, <span class="math inline">\(\sim \log D_{p}\)</span> per site. This leads to entanglement scaling like the logarithm of the physical Hilbert space of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, corresponding to maximally thermal (i.e.: volume-law) entanglement.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the spins are ordered, but the bulk spin-exchange is weaker than the boundary fields, then the boundary spins will follow the field, and the minimal free energy cost occurs when the interface between the boundary domain surrounding <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> follows the geodesic (in <span class="math inline">\(2 d\)</span> RTNs, or more generally a minimal-area spanning surface in arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> -RTNs) from the left edge of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to the right edge (see Fig. 6 ). In a regular <span class="math inline">\(2 d\)</span> RTN, this geodesic scales as the length <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> leading to a volumelaw behavior of the entanglement entropy.</p>

<h4 id="极限低bond">极限：低bond</h4>
<p>In contrast, for low-bond dimension, we expect a disordered (paramagnetic) phase of the spin model, in which the boundary spins align with the boundary field. This paramagnetic phase can be viewed as a bulk "condensate" of domain walls between fluctuating spin domains. This domain wall condensate can freely absorb the extra domain wall extending from the boundary (see Fig. 6 ), such that, for a distance exceeding the correlation length from the boundary, there is no additional free energy cost from the boundary domain. In this regime, there will only be a finite energy cost originating from a region of size the bulk correlation length near the spin-twists at the boundary of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In this limit, the free-energy cost of the boundary domain will scale like the boundary of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, corresponding to area-law scaling of entanglement.</p>
<p>In the following, we confirm these expectations by examining the limiting cases of large and small bond dimension within high- and low- temperature expansions of the spin model.</p>
<h2 id="极限情况">3 极限情况</h2>
<p>We next compute the entanglement entropy of the random tensor network for two simple limiting cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>low bond dimension (corresponding to the high temperature disordered phase of the spin model)</li>
<li>high bond dimension (corresponding to the low temperature ordered phase of the spin model).</li>

F(Q, x)=\sum_{g \in S_{Q-1}}\left(x^{C(g)+1}+\sum_{k=1}^{Q-1} x^{C\left(g t_{k}\right)}\right)=(x+Q-1) F(Q-1, x)

Then from (19) we can evaluate <span class="math display">\[

<p>Assembling these results, the leading order high temperature expansion for the bulk partition function is: <span class="math display">\[
Z ^{(n m)} \approx\left(1+\frac{\pi^{2}}{6} J Q\right)^{\Omega}
\]</span> We notice that to lowest order in the high-temperature expansion, the above answer does not depend on boundary conditions, except for the bonds at the boundaries of the entanglement region crossing from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span>. These give weight <span class="math display">\[
\delta Z _{A} \approx 2 J\left(C\left(g_{ SWAP }\right)-C(1)\right)=2 J(m-n m) 
\]</span> In particular, all other lowest order contributions to the partition function will cancel between <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}^{(n m)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}^{(n m)}\)</span> in Eq. 9. The Renyi entropy from this contribution following Eq. 9 gives: <span class="math display">\[

Although these character sums are difficult to evaluate for general <span class="math inline">\(Q,\)</span> as the detailed group structure changes as a function of <span class="math inline">\(Q,\)</span> we can readily extract some general features without explicit computation.不需要显式计算，我们可以很容易地提取一些一般特征</p>

<li>First, each term will be positive, since the twist of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> from 1 to <span class="math inline">\(g_{\text {SWAP }}\)</span> from one end of the arc to the other in <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}\)</span> reduces the amplitude compared to the untwisted one in <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>.</li>
<li>Next, we can take the crude bound: <span class="math inline">\(C(g)&lt;Q !\)</span> to bound the amplitude of this term by <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Delta Z _{A}\right| \leq \frac{1}{3 !} J^{3}(Q !)^{3}\)</span>. Hence, to this order, the contribution to entanglement is bounded above by:</li>

<p><span class="math display">\[
\delta S_{A} \leq \lim _{Q \rightarrow 0} \partial_{Q} \frac{1}{3 !} J^{3}(Q !)^{3}=\frac{1}{2} J^{3}+ O \left(J^{4}\right)

This general structure continues to higher orders, demonstrating the area-law entanglement within the finite radius of convergence of the high-temperature expansion.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>From now on we use the simplified notation <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}^{(n m)},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}^{(n m)}\)</span></li>
<li>Next, let us consider the opposite limit of large bond dimension (low temperature in the spin model).</li>
<li>We will primarily consider a regular <span class="math inline">\(2 d\)</span> network (e.g. a <span class="math inline">\(2 d\)</span> square lattice) and then comment on other geometries.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, the spin model is deep in the ordered phase, and we can approximate <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}\)</span> (assuming that the bulk bond dimension is much larger than the physical bond dimension, so that the boundary fields <span class="math inline">\(h_{v}\)</span> are ineffective at pinning the spins inside <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\left.g_{\text {SWAP }}\right)\)</span> by a single configuration <span class="math inline">\(\forall i: g_{i}=1,\)</span> which has weight <span class="math inline">\(e^{z \Omega J Q / 2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, consider a <span class="math inline">\(2 d\)</span> square lattice network. The difference between <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}\)</span> for the dominant low-temperature configuration is: <span class="math display">\[

\end{aligned}
\]</span> Differentiating with respect to <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and setting <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to zero (recall <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0} \rightarrow 1\)</span> in this limit) gives: <span class="math display">\[
S_{A}^{(n)} \approx \sum_{v \in A} h_{v}=L_{A} \log D_{p}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(D_{p}\)</span> is the on-site Hilbert space dimension of the physical degrees of freedom (see the line below Eq. 17 ).</p>
<p>Thus, the low-temperature (large bond dimension) expansion, gives high-temperature thermal entanglement behavior, in stark contrast to the area-law behavior observed in the high-temperature expansion for low bond dimension. The finite radius of convergence for the highand low- temperature expansions in the spin-model indicate that there must be a critical point in which the replica spins order, i.e. in which the tensor network wavefunction changes from area- to volume- law. Before investigating the properties of this transition for regular <span class="math inline">\(2 d\)</span> networks, we briefly comment on other possible tensor network geometries.</p>

<p>Besides the regular <span class="math inline">\(2 d\)</span> tensor network considered above, the low-temperature expansion can be easily be extended to arbitrary graphs.</p>
<p>In each case the low temperature regime of the effective spin model will be dominated by the spin configuration which has <span class="math inline">\(g_{i}=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(g_{\text {SWAP }}\)</span> for a region including the boundary region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and extending into the bulk into some region whose boundary cuts the minimal number of bonds, and <span class="math inline">\(g_{i}=1\)</span> everywhere else.</p>
<p>The resulting entanglement will then scale as the surface area of the minimal bulk region (see Fig. 1), reproducing the Ryu-Takayanagi formula [46] and agreeing with the infinite <span class="math inline">\(D_{e}\)</span> results of Hayden et al [65].

\]</span> Here, we have introduced the free energies <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> where as before <span class="math inline">\(Z \rightarrow Z _{0}=\overline{\left(\operatorname{tr} \rho^{n}\right)^{m}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z \rightarrow Z _{A}=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\left(\operatorname{tr} \rho_{A}^{n}\right)^{m}},\)</span> and we have used the fact that <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}= Z _{A}=1\)</span> in the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0\)</span> to introduce the extra logarithms required to convert powers of partition functions <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}\)</span> to free energies. As we have argued above, these traces can be interpreted as actual partition functions of a statistical mechanics model defined on the graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> with spins <span class="math inline">\(g_{v} \in S_{Q=n m} .\)</span> The partition function <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}\)</span> has a boundary field that favors the trivial permutation, while <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}\)</span> has a boundary field favoring <span class="math inline">\(g_{\text {SWAP }}\)</span> on the entanglement interval <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g=1\)</span> on its complement <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A} .\)</span> In the high temperature (low bond dimension) limit, the free energy cost <span class="math inline">\(F_{A}-F_{0}\)</span> of this domain wall vanishes so that the Renyi entropies satisfy an area law <span class="math inline">\(S_{n} \sim\)</span> cst, while a low temperature expansion simply gives <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A} \sim Z _{0} D_{p}^{m(1-n) L_{A}}\)</span> to leading order, where <span class="math inline">\(L_{A}\)</span> is the length of the interval <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, implying a volume law scaling <span class="math inline">\(S_{n}=\left(\log D_{p}\right) L_{A}\)</span> deep in the ordered <span class="math inline">\(\left(D_{e} \rightarrow \infty\right)\)</span> phase. (Recall that <span class="math inline">\(D_{p}\)</span> is the dimension of the physical Hilbert space.) We expect [97] a critical point separating these two phases for a critical coupling <span class="math inline">\(J_{c}(n m)\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(J=\log D_{e}\)</span> ), and our goal is to keep track of the universal properties of this transition as <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0\)</span></p>
<p>A simple point of our model is given by <span class="math inline">\(Q=n m=2\)</span> which corresponds to the two-dimension Ising model. In general, assuming that the transition is of second order, it should be described a by Conformal Field Theory (CFT). Since in the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0\)</span>, the partition functions become unity <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}= Z _{A}=1,\)</span> we know that the central charge of the CFT in that limit is <span class="math inline">\(c=0\)</span>. (This is because <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> measures the way the free energy changes when a finite scale is introduced: since here the partition function is trivial for any finite size system, this immediately implies that <span class="math inline">\(c=0 .\)</span> ) Since the only unitary CFT with <span class="math inline">\(c=0\)</span> is the trivial theory with a single identity operator, we know that the CFT we are after is in a class of non-unitary Logarithmic CFTs (LCFT) <span class="math inline">\([98-101]\)</span>, where the non-unitarity leads to the appearance of the logarithmic correlations even at the critical point - we will come back to this point below. Importantly, since the bulk properties of the transition only depend on the product <span class="math inline">\(Q=n m \rightarrow 0,\)</span> the location of the bulk transition point as well as all <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 0\)</span> bulk critical exponents are the same for all Renyi entropies in the limit <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 0\)</span>. (This includes in particular the correlation length exponent <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{Q} \rightarrow \nu\)</span> which is thus the same for all Renyi entropies in the limit <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 0\)</span> ). This is in sharp contrast with the construction of Hayden et al. deep in the ordered phase[65], where different Renyi entropies correspond to distinct classical spin models, and are expected to have transitions (possibly of first order) at different values of <span class="math inline">\(D_{e}\)</span></p>
<p>To analyze the scaling of the entanglement entropy at the critical point, we note that the ratio of partition functions <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A} / Z _{0}\)</span> that appears in the free energy difference <span class="math inline">\(F_{A}-F_{0}=-\log \frac{ Z _{A}}{ Z _{0}},\)</span> corresponds in the CFT language to the two-point function of boundary condition changing <span class="math inline">\(( BCC )\)</span> operators <span class="math inline">\([102,103] .\)</span> Note that strictly speaking, the boundary fields break conformal invariance but on large distances we expect these fields to flow to infinity, corresponding to conformally invariant fixed boundary conditions where the spins are pinned to the identity perturbation or to <span class="math inline">\(g_{\text {SWAP. }}\)</span> Introducing the operator <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{ BCC }\)</span> that implements this change of boundary condition, <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A} / Z _{0}=\left\langle\phi_{ BCC }\left(L_{A}\right) \phi_{ BCC }(0)\right\rangle\)</span> where the operators are inserted at the boundary of the entanglement interval <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In general, there are non-universal extensive terms corresponding to the difference of boundary free energies associated with the different boundary conditions, but this difference vanishes by symmetry in our case since our two boundary conditions where the spins are fixed to different values are related by symmetry. As an instructive example, let us briefly discuss the Ising model case <span class="math inline">\(Q=n m=2\)</span> (say, <span class="math inline">\(m=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n=2\)</span> ): then <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A} / Z _{0}\)</span> can be mapped by duality to the spin-spin correlation function in the dual model. In the ordered phase, the spin-spin correlation function in the dual model is disordered and decays exponentially, leading to a volume-law contribution to the entanglement, whereas in the disor-dered phase, the dual model has long-range order so the spin-spin correlation function tends to a constant at large separation, leading to area law entanglement. This can of course be interpreted in terms of domain wall free energy cost. The corresponding BCC operator that implements a change between boundary conditions where the spins are pinned down to opposite directions has scaling dimension <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=\frac{1}{2}\)</span>. Going back to the replica limit, we find that the Renyi entropies scale as <span class="math display">\[
S_{A}^{(n)}=\frac{2}{n-1} \lim _{m \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{m} \Delta(n, m) \log L_{A}+ cst
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta(n, m)\)</span> is the dimension of the <span class="math inline">\(BCC\)</span> operator as-sociated with the boundary field in the entanglement interval <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in the CFT describing the critical point. Note that because the change in boundary conditions becomes trivial for <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span> and/or <span class="math inline">\(n=1,\)</span> we expect <span class="math inline">\(\Delta(n, m)\)</span> to vanish in these limits, making (26) well defined.</p>
<p>Away from the critical point, the two point function of the BCC operators should scale as <span class="math inline">\(C_{n, m} / L_{A}^{2 \Delta(n, m)} f_{n, m}\left(L_{A} / \xi_{n m}\right),\)</span> leading to the following scaling form for the Renyi entropies by using the replica trick <span class="math display">\[
S_{A}^{(n)}=\left.\frac{2}{n-1} \frac{\partial \Delta}{\partial m}\right|_{m=0} \log L_{A}+C_{n}+f_{n}\left(\frac{L_{A}}{\xi}\right)
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\xi \sim\left|D-D_{c}\right|^{-\nu}\)</span> the correlation length in the limit <span class="math inline">\(Q=n m \rightarrow 0, f_{n}\)</span> some universal scaling functions and <span class="math inline">\(C_{n}\)</span> some non-universal constants. In order to isolate the universal contributions, one can also take the derivative with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\log L_{A}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
L_{A} \frac{\partial S_{A}^{(n)}}{\partial L_{A}}=g_{n}\left(\frac{L_{A}}{\xi}\right)

<p>To identify the relevant CFT in the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(0,\)</span> we first need to analytically continue our spin model to real values of <span class="math inline">\(Q=n m\)</span>.

<p>First note that the function <span class="math inline">\(C(g)\)</span> that counts the number of cycles in the permutation <span class="math inline">\(g \in S_{Q}\)</span> is a class function as it satisfies <span class="math inline">\(C(g)=C\left(h^{-1} g h\right)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(h \in S_{Q} .\)</span> A complete basis for such class functions is given by the characters of the group <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{\xi}(g)=\operatorname{tr}_{V_{\xi}} g\)</span> given by the trace of the representation of the group element <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in the irreducible representation (irrep) <span class="math inline">\(V_{\xi},\)</span> where we used <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> to label irreps. For reasons that will become clear below, we define <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\chi}_{\xi}(g)=\chi_{\xi}(g) \frac{\operatorname{dim} V_{\xi}}{Q !} .\)</span> By decomposing the Boltzmann weights onto these (modified) irreducible characters, we write <span class="math display">\[
Z _{0} \propto \sum_{\left\{g_{v} \in S_{Q}\right\}} \prod_{\left\langle v, v^{\prime}\right\rangle}\left(1+\sum_{\xi \neq 1} K_{\xi} \bar{\chi}_{\xi}\left(g_{v}^{-1} g_{v^{\prime}}\right)\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\xi \neq 1\)</span> labels irreps different from the trivial one. The couplings <span class="math inline">\(K_{\xi}\)</span> can be computed exactly for our microscopic interaction <span class="math inline">\(e ^{J C\left(g_{v}^{-1} g_{v^{\prime}}\right)}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[

Nevertheless the precise expression is not important in what follows. Since we are interested in universal properties, we will consider a more general model where the couplings <span class="math inline">\(K_{\xi}\)</span> are arbitrary. By expanding this product and summing over the spins, we get a high temperature expansion with loops carrying a label (or color) associated with the irrep <span class="math inline">\(\xi,\)</span> as illustrated in Fig. 7. Diagrams with "tadpoles" are forbidden since <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{g} \chi_{\xi}(g)=0,\)</span> and different irreps cannot propagate in the same loop thanks to the convolution formula <span class="math display">\[
\sum_{h \in S_{Q}} \bar{\chi}_{\xi}\left(g h^{-1}\right) \bar{\chi}_{\xi^{\prime}}(h)=\delta_{\xi, \xi^{\prime}} \bar{\chi}_{\xi}(g)
\]</span> These loops can branch and cross, with a condition related to the decomposition of the tensor products of the associated irreps containing the trivial representation. To specify the general weights of diagrams, we evoke the mathematical structure of the representation category of the symmetric group, <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Rep}_{S_{Q}}\)</span>, which is the fusion category formed by the irreps of <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span>. All admissible diagrams <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that contribute to the partition function <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}\)</span> satisfy the fusion <span class="math inline">\(\left(=\right.\)</span> Clebsch-Gordon) rules of <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Rep}_{S_{Q}}\)</span>. The loop model is given by <span class="math display">\[
Z _{0}=\sum_{X}\left(\prod_{\xi} K_{\xi}^{\left|X_{\xi}\right|}\right) \Phi(X)^{2}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\left|X_{\xi}\right|\)</span> is the total length of the <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> -type string in the diagram <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(X)\)</span> is the string-net amplitude of <span class="math inline">\(X .\)</span> The couplings <span class="math inline">\(K_{\xi}\)</span> set the string tension and the remaining part <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(X)^{2}\)</span> is topological.

Given a string-net configuration <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, one can always use the local transformations to deform <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to the trivial configuration with no strings.

For the symmetric group <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q},\)</span> all <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> -symbols of the irreps can be chosen real, so the amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(X)\)</span> is also real and its square <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(X)^{2}\)</span> is positive. By introducing an unnormalized string-net wave function <span class="math display">\[

<p>上述高温膨胀导致了一个复杂的分支环branching loops模型。为了取得进一步的进展，因此，我们将通过修改耦合$ K _ { xi} $来考虑该模型的简化版本。</p>
<p>The above high temperature expansion leads to a complicated model of branching loops ("nets"), with one flavor of loop per non-trivial irreducible representation. This loop model is very complicated in general, and is still hard to analytically continue to <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span> since the number of loop flavors depends on <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. To make further progress, we will therefore consider simpler versions of that model by modifying the couplings <span class="math inline">\(K_{\xi}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We will consider an especially simple choice of couplings that makes the model tractable, but that also accidentally enlarges the symmetry of the model. We will then study the stability of the fixed point we find in the model with simplified couplings, to symmetry-breaking perturbations that should appear for the generic physical couplings corresponding to the spin model (11), and infer from there the fate of the true infrared (IR) fixed point.</p>
<p>Our first step is to consider a specific choice for the couplings <span class="math inline">\(K_{\xi}\)</span>. A simple choice is provided by considering uniform couplings over all characters <span class="math inline">\(K_{\xi}=K,\)</span> in which case eq. (29) can be simplified using the identity <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{\xi} \bar{\chi}_{\xi}(g)=\delta_{g, 1}\)</span>. In that case, the partition function reduces to <span class="math display">\[
Z _{0}=\sum_{\left\{g_{v} \in S_{Q}\right\}} \prod_{\left\langle v, v^{\prime}\right\rangle}\left(1-K+K \delta_{g_{v}, g_{v^{\prime}}}\right)
\]</span> up to normalization factors that tend to one in the <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 0\)</span> limit. This coincides with the high temperature expansion of a Potts model with <span class="math inline">\(Q !=\left|S_{Q}\right|\)</span> states. The product in this partition function can be expanded onto the socalled Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters [104] where an edge is occupied with weight <span class="math inline">\(K,\)</span> not occupied with weight <span class="math inline">\(1-K\)</span>, and where each connected cluster (including single sites) carries a weight <span class="math inline">\(Q !\)</span> (the number of states).</p>
<p><strong>In the replica <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{limit} Q \rightarrow 0\)</span>, this maps onto a bond percolation problem where <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the probability for a bond to be occupied.</strong></p>
<p>The partition function in that limit is <span class="math inline">\(Z _{0}=1\)</span> as needed, and the CFT corresponding to the critical point <span class="math inline">\(K_{c}=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> on the square lattice has central charge <span class="math inline">\(c=0\)</span> as required by the general considerations mentioned above.

<h3 id="stability-of-the-percolation-fixed-point">Stability of the percolation fixed point</h3>
<p>Whereas the above percolation fixed point could be a reasonable candidate for the transition in the replica limit, it is important to notice that our choice of couplings <span class="math inline">\(K_{\xi}=K\)</span> enlarged the symmetry of the model dramatically. Starting from a model with <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span> symmetry (or <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q} \times S_{Q}\)</span> corresponding to right and left multiplication) we obtained a model with a much larger <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> symmetry. To study if this enlarged symmetry is emerging at the critical point for generic couplings, we study the stability of this <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> fixed point against including <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q^{-} \text {symmetric }}\)</span> perturbations that break the <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> symmetry.</p>
<p>We first recall the formulation of the Potts field theory with <span class="math inline">\(Q !\)</span> states. Let <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{a}\)</span> denote the coarse-grained order parameter of the Potts model obtained as the scaling limit of the magnetization operator. It has <span class="math inline">\((Q !-1)\)</span> components as it satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{a=1}^{Q !} \phi_{a}=0 .\)</span> In terms of this order parameter, one can write an effective Landau theory <span class="math display">\[
L _{\text {Potts }}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{a}\left(\partial_{\mu} \phi_{a}\right)^{2}+\frac{m^{2}}{2} \sum_{a} \phi_{a}^{2}+g \sum_{a} \phi_{a}^{3}+\ldots,(34)
\]</span> with the crucial constraint <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{a} \phi_{a}=0 .\)</span> For <span class="math inline">\(Q !&lt;2,\)</span> a perturbative RG analysis near the upper critical dimension <span class="math inline">\(d_{ uc }=6\)</span> shows the existence of a non-trivial fixed point describing a second-order phase transition. Note that for <span class="math inline">\(Q !=2, \sum_{a} \phi_{a}^{n}\)</span> vanishes for any odd <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (and <span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span> in particular) because of the <span class="math inline">\(S_{2}= Z _{2}\)</span> symmetry of the Ising model. In two dimensions, the operator content at the critical point is well-known [106]:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="1">
<li>There are thermal perturbations that transform trivially under <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> ! among which the first thermal operator is relevant and drives the transition (it has scaling dimension <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{\epsilon}=\frac{5}{4}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(Q=0) ;\)</span></li>
</ol></li>
<li>(2)There are magnetic operators that transform as <span class="math inline">\([Q !-1,1]\)</span> under <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\([Q !-1,1]\)</span> denotes the Young tableau with 2 rows having <span class="math inline">\((Q !-1)\)</span> boxes in the first row and one box in the second row;</li>
<li><ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Finally there are the so-called <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> -hull operators with <span class="math inline">\(M \geq 2\)</span> integer, which can be thought of as creating <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters (percolation clusters for <span class="math inline">\(Q=0)-\)</span> they transform under the symmetry as <span class="math inline">\([Q !-M, M]\)</span>.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>This <span class="math inline">\(Q !\)</span> -state Potts model has a <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> symmetry where the action of <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> onto the fields <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{a}\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{a} \longrightarrow\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{g(a)},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a=1, \ldots, Q !\)</span> are some Potts colors (or states) and <span class="math inline">\(g \in S_{Q !}\)</span> is a permutation of these colors. We want to include perturbations that break this <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> symmetry down to the subgroup <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q} \subset S_{Q !}\)</span> defined by the action <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{a} \longrightarrow \phi_{h a},\)</span> where we now think of <span class="math inline">\(a \in S_{Q}\)</span> as being an element of <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h \in S_{Q}\)</span> acts on <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> by left multiplication. It is straightforward to show that the leading perturbation implementing the symmetry breaking <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !} \longrightarrow S_{Q}\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[
L = L _{\text {Potts }}+\sum_{a, b \in S_{Q}} W\left(a^{-1} b\right) \phi_{a} \phi_{b}+\ldots
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is a class function of <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span>. Again, crucially the labels <span class="math inline">\(a, b\)</span> are now interpreted as elements of the group <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q} .\)</span> The only allowed function <span class="math inline">\(W\left(a^{-1} b\right)\)</span> that would respect the <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> symmetry is <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{a, b},\)</span> but any class function of <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span> is enough to satisfy the <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span> (in fact more precisely, the <span class="math inline">\(\left.S_{Q} \times S_{Q}\right)\)</span> symmetry. The perturbations <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{a} \phi_{b}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a \neq b\)</span> are therefore allowed by <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q} \times S_{Q}\)</span> even if they break <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span>, and they should generally be included in the action. They correspond to the two-hull operator mentioned above: they have scaling dimension <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{2-\text { hull }}=\frac{5}{4}&lt;2\)</span> at the percolation fixed point (in the limit <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 0\)</span> ) and they are therefore relevant. We conclude that the percolation fixed point for <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 0\)</span> is generically unstable and thus fine-tuned, and flows to a different fixed point in the infrared (IR)</p>
<h3 id="fate-of-the-perturbed-percolation-fixed-point">Fate of the perturbed percolation fixed point</h3>
<p>Even if the percolation fixed point with enlarged <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> symmetry (in the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 0\)</span> ) is unstable, we anticipate that it will provide a useful starting point to analyze the IR fixed point. The quantum field theory describing the IR fixed point is among a class a notably complicated CFTs with <span class="math inline">\(c=0\)</span> called Logarithmic CFTs <span class="math inline">\([98-101]\)</span>, which are poorly understood and for which a classification is still lacking. From the above analysis, we know that it corresponds to a Potts model with <span class="math inline">\(Q !\)</span> states perturbed by a two-hull operator, in the <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{limit} Q \rightarrow 0-\)</span> preserving the symmetry group <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q} \times S_{Q}\)</span> The fate of the percolation critical point perturbed by a two-hull operator has been studied recently [107,108] in a different context, and it was found that in that case the critical point fans out into a gapless "Goldstone" phase <span class="math inline">\([107],\)</span> where there are Goldstone modes living on the sphere <span class="math inline">\(S^{N-1}=O(N) / O(N-1)\)</span> in the limit <span class="math inline">\(N \rightarrow 1[109] .\)</span> Although this result was derived in a different context (in particular with a pattern of symmetry breaking that is very different from our case), this may perhaps suggest the intriguing possibility of having an intermediate gapless phase in our model as well. It would be interesting to investigate this limit further, possibly by using a different truncation of eq. (32) (for example, restricting to a single character). We leave a detailed analysis of the field theory of the critical point on regular planar graphs for future work.</p>
<h3 id="randomness-in-the-bond-dimension">Randomness in the bond dimension</h3>
<p>We have so far considered the simplifying case of fixed bond dimension <span class="math inline">\(D_{e},\)</span> which is an integer for each edge. In contrast, the critical bond dimension <span class="math inline">\(D_{c}\)</span> corresponding to the area-to-volume-law transition will generically be noninteger. There are two possible schemes to access this entanglement transition in random tensor network states. One way is to consider replacing the maximally entangled pair on each edge by a generic entangled pair, as specified in Eq. <span class="math inline">\(2 .\)</span> In this way, the "effective" bond dimension will be continuously tunable by varying the bond mutual information <span class="math inline">\(I_{e}^{(n)} .\)</span> A similar setup was also discussed in Ref. 95 to allow the application of machine learning techniques to find the optimal RTN representation of given entanglement features. Another way to access the entanglement transition is to consider inhomogeneous and random bond dimension, whose typical value is equal to <span class="math inline">\(D_{c}\)</span> : <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\log D_{e}}=\log D_{c} .\)</span> If the fluctuations in <span class="math inline">\(D_{e}\)</span> are sufficiently weak, we can address their effect on the critical properties of the model perturbatively. Assuming that the bond dimensions are log-normally distributed, i.i.d. on each bond (corresponding to i.i.d. Gaussian randomness of the spin couplings in the equivalent stat-mech model), then by the usual Harris criterion, the bond dimension disorder is an irrelevant perturbation when <span class="math inline">\(\nu&gt;1\)</span> (for a tensor network defined on a regular two-dimensional lattice <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> ).</p>

<h3 id="universality-and-phase-transitions-for-a-random-geometry">Universality and phase transitions for a random geometry</h3>
<p>While considering random PEPS living on fixed regular graphs is interesting, we do not know the actual geometry of the bulk tensor network that would correspond to physical entanglement transitions, including the MBL transition for example. Following the random matrix theory logic, it is natural to take that geometry also to be random: if universal features remain for completely random networks defined on random planar graphs, there are likely to describe universal features of entanglement transitions in more realistic many-body quantum systems. More precisely, we will consider a random tensor network whose vertices live on a random trivalent graph the trivalent nature of the graph will be irrelevant for the phase transition. We will also restrict to graphs with the topology of a disk so that they have a proper boundary (Euler characteristic <span class="math inline">\(\chi=1\)</span> ). Instead of working with a fixed random graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(N=|G|\)</span> vertices, it is convenient to work in the "grand canonical" ensemble, and to introduce a chemical potential <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> conjugated to the mass of the graph <span class="math inline">\(N=|G|\)</span> (also called cosmological constant for reasons that will become clear below). Following the replica trick strategy developed above, the entanglement entropy averaged over an ensemble of random graphs can be inferred from the analytic continuation <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0\)</span> of a spin model now defined on fluctuating graphs <span class="math display">\[
Z _{\text {random }}=\sum_{G} \frac{1}{S(G)} e ^{-\Lambda|G|} Z ^{(n m)}(G)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S(G)\)</span> is the symmetry factor of the graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. We are only interested in "quenched" quantum gravity where the random graphs are generated with a probability distribution independent of the statistical mechanics model. Note that since <span class="math inline">\(Z _{S_{n m}}=1\)</span> in the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span>, there is in fact no difference between quenched and annealed averages over the random graphs for the cases of interest to us. The critical behavior of the Renyi entropies averaged over disorder of the Random Tensor Network, as well as over fluctuating graphs, can therefore be obtained directly from the replica limit of our <span class="math inline">\(S_{n m}\)</span> Stat. Mech. model defined on annealed fluctuating lattices. In particular, there is no back-action of the "matter" (= the Stat. Mech. model) on the random gravity in the replica limit. The coupling to fluctuating graphs leads to a new critical point which can be interpreted as coupling the CFT obtained on a regular graph (say, a square lattice) to two-dimensional quantum gravity <span class="math inline">\([110-112] .\)</span> Formally, if <span class="math inline">\(S_{ CFT }\left[g_{\mu \nu}, \phi, m\right]\)</span> denotes the action of the CFT in a fixed background metric <span class="math inline">\(g_{\mu \nu}\)</span> perturbed by the mass term <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> (coupling to the energy operator tuning through the transition), the partition function on fluctuating lattices can be expressed as <span class="math inline">\([113-115]\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
Z _{\text {random }} \approx \int D \phi D g e ^{-\int d^{2} x \sqrt{g}\left(\Lambda-\frac{\gamma}{4 \pi} R\right)-S_{ CFT }\left[g_{\mu \nu}, \phi, m\right]}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> is once again our cosmological constant weighting the mass <span class="math inline">\(\int d^{2} x \sqrt{g}\)</span> of the "universe", and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4 \pi} \int R=\chi\)</span> is a topological term with <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> the Euler characteristic of the graph (Gauss-Bonnet theorem), where <span class="math inline">\(\chi=1\)</span> in our case since we are considering planar graphs with the topology of a disk. The Hilbert-Einstein part of the action is therefore topological in two dimensions.</p>
<p>Upon tuning the cosmological constant <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> to obtain an infinite graph (thermodynamic limit), a phase transition can be induced by simultaneously tuning the coupling <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to the transition. This new critical point can be interpreted as a new CFT "dressed" by quantum gravity, and the new scaling dimensions are given by the so-called Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (KPZ) formula [114]. In particular, the new dimension (=conformal weight) of the energy operator is given by <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{h}_{\epsilon}=\frac{\sqrt{1+24 h_{\epsilon}}-1}{4}
\]</span> in the new <span class="math inline">\(c=0\)</span> CFT dressed by quantum gravity, where <span class="math inline">\(\nu=\frac{1}{2-2 h_{\epsilon}}\)</span> is the correlation exponent, and <span class="math inline">\(h_{\epsilon}\)</span> is the energy operator dimension (=conformal weight) for the CFT in a flat background. This formula can be derived purely from a field theory framework, and it was checked against the exact solution of various statistical mechanics models defined on random graphs.</p>
<p>To determine the relevant exponent for our physical system at the boundary, recall that we are interested in the "canonical ensemble" where the number of sites <span class="math inline">\(N=|G|\)</span> is fixed and going to infinity in the thermodynamical limit. From the quantum gravity results, we expect some finite size scaling near the transition in terms of the dimensionless quantity <span class="math inline">\(\left(D_{e}-D_{c}\right) N^{1 /\left(\tilde{\nu} d_{F}\right)}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\nu} d_{F}=\frac{1}{1-\tilde{h}_{\epsilon}},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_{F}\)</span> is the fractal dimension of the random graph G. The fractal dimension factor <span class="math inline">\(d_{F}\)</span> comes from the fact that the random graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is typically very "spiky", and the relevant fractal dimension in our case is <span class="math inline">\(d_{F}=4\)</span> - this is the fractal dimension of "pure" gravity without matter, appropriate since our CFT has central charge <span class="math inline">\(c=0 .\)</span> Letting <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> be the linear extent of our system (defined in terms of geodesics), the number of vertices scales as <span class="math inline">\(N \sim L^{d_{F}}\)</span>. Despite this anomalous fractal dimension, it can be shown that even for these random graphs, one still has <span class="math inline">\(|\partial G| \propto|G|^{1 / 2},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(|\partial G|\)</span> is the number of boundary vertices of <span class="math inline">\(G .\)</span> This means that if we let <span class="math inline">\(L=|\partial G|\)</span> be the size <span class="math inline">\((=\)</span> number of vertices <span class="math inline">\()\)</span> of our physical spin model living at the boundary of the random tensor network, we have <span class="math inline">\(N \sim L^{2}\)</span> and the relevant finite size scaling variable in terms of the number of spins at the boundary is <span class="math inline">\(\left(D_{e}-D_{c}\right) L^{2 /\left(\tilde{\nu} d_{F}\right)} .\)</span> We therefore identify the physical correlation length defined in units of the number of boundary spins as <span class="math display">\[
\xi_{\star} \sim\left|D_{e}-D_{c}\right|^{-\nu_{\star}}
\]</span> with <span class="math display">\[
\nu_{\star}=\frac{\tilde{\nu} d_{F}}{2}=\frac{2}{5-\sqrt{25-\frac{12}{\nu}}}
\]</span> where we have used the KPZ formula (38) with <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> the correlation length exponent on a regular graph. If the bulk theory is controlled by the percolation fixed point with <span class="math inline">\(\nu=4 / 3,\)</span> this yields <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{\star}=2 .\)</span> Interestingly, this saturates the Harris bound <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{\star} \geq 2\)</span> for the disordered physical 1d boundary spins. We conjecture that the correlation length exponent at the true IR fixed point on a regular lattice satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\nu&gt;\frac{4}{3}\)</span> (which is typical for "quantum percolation" problems), which implies that <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{\star} \geq 2\)</span> on a random lattice so that the Harris bound is satisfied.</p>
<h3 id="non-thermal-entanglement-scaling">Non-thermal entanglement scaling</h3>
<p>Besides changing the universality class of the transition and renormalizing the critical exponents, the random geometry also has important consequences for the scaling of entanglement in the large bond dimension (ordered) phase. Recall that at large bond dimension, entanglement is determined by geodesics: if we consider an entanglement interval of size <span class="math inline">\(L_{A}\)</span> sites at the boundary, in the limit <span class="math inline">\(D_{e} \rightarrow \infty\)</span> the entanglement is given by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula [46], that is, by a minimal cut through the tensor network -minimizing the energy cost of the domain wall in the spin model language. On a regular (say, square) lattice, this geodesic scales as the size of the interval <span class="math inline">\(\sim L_{A},\)</span> but on a random lattice this scaling is very different. In particular, recall that if one considers a subsystem containing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices, a geodesic joining the boundaries of this box scales only as <span class="math inline">\(n^{1 / d_{F}}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(d_{F}=4,\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span> for a regular <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> lattice. Similarly because <span class="math inline">\(N \sim L^{2}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> the number of boundary spins, the boundary of the random graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has fractal dimension <span class="math inline">\(d_{F}^{b}=2,\)</span> which implies that for a boundary interval of length <span class="math inline">\(L_{A},\)</span> the minimal cut of the tensor network (geodesic) scales as <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{L_{A}}\)</span> (Fig. 8). This implies that the entanglement has a power-law scaling in the large bond dimension phase <span class="math display">\[
S_{A} \sim \sqrt{L_{A}}
\]</span> corresponding to a non-ergodic phase since this scaling violates ETH. Random tensor networks defined on random geometry can therefore be used to obtain a powerlaw scaling of entanglement. In fact, the fractal dimension of the random geometry can be tuned by weighting differently the random graphs (recall that above, we chose a uniform measure consistent with the fact that the Einstein-Hilbert action is trivial in two dimensions). In the field theory language, this can be interpreted as adding background matter fields that have a non-trivial back-action on the random geometry, thus modifying the fractal dimension. It should also be possible to change the measure over the random graphs - corresponding to adding "matter" at the boundary - to modify the relation <span class="math inline">\(|\partial G| \propto|G|^{1 / 2}\)</span> for example. This can be used as a knob to change the nature of the entanglement transition. We leave the study of the entanglement properties of random tensor networks defined on such weighted random graphs for future work.</p>
<h2 id="讨论">6 讨论</h2>
<p>Our approach uncovers a new class of phase transitions between quantum states with sharply different entanglement scaling. Employing a replica trick enables us to obtain analytic results for arbitrary bond dimension, which in the holographic language corresponds to strong quantum gravity fluctuations in the bulk geometry. Although we defer a detailed analytic understanding of the CFT describing the transition for RTN on regular planar graphs to future work, we emphasize that our approach allows us to formulate a statistical mechanics and field theoretical formulation of such entanglement transitions in any dimension and/or geometry. A promising future application of these ideas could be to examine quantum dynamics under random unitary circuits, away from the large- <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> limit, which limited previous studies <span class="math inline">\([80-\)</span> 87] to maximally scrambling systems, whose dynamics are effectively classical and mean-field like by construction (see [86,87] for recent progress in that direction).For RTN, our results also provide <span class="math inline">\(1 / N\)</span> quantum corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula which would be interesting to compare to the gravity expectations.</p>
<p>Before concluding, we examine the relationship between the properties of the area-to-volume law entanglement transition in RTN states, to the many-body (de)localization transition between MBL and thermal states. The most notable distinction is that whereas the RTN states exhibit a continuous second order transition between area and volume states, the entanglement has been predicted to jump discontinuously across the MBL transition [34,38] . The discontinuity for the direct MBL-to-thermal transition necessarily arises since entanglement of any sub-interval of a thermal system must be extensive, with the volume-law coefficient equal to the thermodynamic entropy density [116]. However, infinitesimally on the MBL side of the transition, the entanglement must be sub-thermal, requiring a discontinuity [34]. In contrast, the RTN entanglement entropy near the area-to-volume law transition behaves like a more typical observable, exhibiting a continuous cross-over as the entanglement sub-region length passes through the correlation length of the transition. In fact, the absence of a discontinuity in the volume-law component of the entanglement across the RTN transition signals that the volume-law phase of the RTN states is not fully thermal, and does not satisfy ETH [116]. Exploring the nature of such states which are volume-law entangled, and whether they are related to the eigenstates of a particular class of parent Hamiltonians presents an interesting challenge for future work.</p>
<p>After the first version of this manuscript appeared on ArXiv, a possibly related entanglement transition in random unitary circuits with projective measurements was proposed in Refs. [117-120]. The scaling observed nu-merically at that transition appears to be compatible with a dynamical exponent <span class="math inline">\(z=1\)</span> and conformal invariance. This suggests that this measurement-induced transition can be described by a (replica) statistical mechanics model similar to what we discussed above. It would be interesting to determine the relation to the entanglement transition in RTN in future works.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to investigate random tensor networks numerically to check our scaling predictions. We note that although the critical bond dimension <span class="math inline">\(D_{c}\)</span> is non-universal and depends on the bulk lattice, we expect it to be low. In particular, it is possible that <span class="math inline">\(1&lt;D_{c}&lt;2\)</span>, consistent with the natural expectation that random tensor networks with finite bond dimension are highly entangled. We expect the generalized PEPS wavefunctions (4) to be useful to access a regime of non-integer bond dimension numerically.</p>
<p>Another potentially interesting direction would be to incorporate the effects of global symmetries on the entanglement structure of RTN, which produce a local gauge structure in the bulk [121], and could potentially alter the universal scaling properties of the entanglement transition.</p>

<p>Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role in modern condensed matter physics, both in equilibrium and nonequilibrium settings. Under unitary evolution, the entanglement of generic isolated many-body quantum systems tends to increase to a volume-law scaling of the entanglement entropies of subsystems <span class="math inline">\([2-10],\)</span> as required by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis [11,12]<span class="math inline">\(( ETH )\)</span> It is then natural to ask whether different dynamical phases with different entanglement scaling can exist, and about the nature of the entanglement transitions separating these entanglement phases. An example of such an entanglement transition is provided by the many-body localization (MBL) transition <span class="math inline">\([13-24],\)</span> which occurs in the presence of random or quasiperiodic potentials, and separates the volume-law thermal dynamical phase from an area-law (non-thermal) MBL phase <span class="math inline">\([25-32]\)</span>.</p>

<p>Shortly after, another type of entanglement transition was proposed using projective measurements: if a manybody quantum system is subjected to enough local measurements, such measurements can collapse the manybody wavefunction into an area-law entangled state, while with a low density of measurements, volume-law entanglement can survive. Such measurement-induced transitions in random unitary circuits <span class="math inline">\([7,33-40]\)</span> subjected to random local measurements were first intro-duced in Refs. <span class="math inline">\([41-43],\)</span> and were studied numerically both for Haar and Clifford random gates.

<p>In this paper, we provide a theory of the projective measurement-induced entanglement transition (with Haar random unitary gates) by mapping the calculation of entanglement entropies onto a statistical mechanics model. Our approach relies on a replica trick which allows us to deal with the intrinsic non-linearities of projective measurements. The area- to volume-law entanglement transition then corresponds to an ordering transition in the statistical mechanics model. This naturally explains the emergence of conformal invariance at the transition, and leads to universal scaling forms for the entanglement entropy and mutual information. In the limit of infinite on-site Hilbert space dimension <span class="math inline">\(d=\infty\)</span>, we find that the entanglement transition is in the percolation universality class, and we compute the exact value of the universal coefficient of the logarithm of subsystem size in all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th Rényi entropies for <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span> from the exactly known CFT, obtaining the value <span class="math inline">\(=1 / 6\)</span> for the entanglement of half of the system and open boundary conditions. This is in contrast to the value of the universal coefficient of the logarithm of subsystem size of the zeroth Rényi entropy computed in the same setting, as mentioned above, in Ref. 41 using the 'minimal cut' method, which was found in that work to be equal to <span class="math inline">\(\approx 0.27\)</span>. The fact that these two universal mumbers differ (by about a factor of two) appears to indicate that, while in the limit of infinite on-site Hilbert space dimension, the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th Rényi entropies for <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span> and the zeroth Rényi entropy <span class="math inline">\(S_{0}\)</span> happen to become critical at the same parameter value (probability of measurement), they describe rather different and unrelated properties of the system. (This is in line with the observation, mentioned above, that these two quantities become critical at different parameter values in the generic case of finite on-site Hilbert space dimension.) The limit of infinite on-site Hilbert space dimension also allows us to identify the generic transition for finite on-site Hilbert space dimension as that generated by a crossover from the percolation conformal field theory by a single (Renormalization Group) relevant perturbation.</p>

<p>We study the discrete-time dynamics of a <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> 'qudit' chain. That is, each site of this <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> qudit chain has a local Hilbert space of dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. The discrete-time dynamics we focus on is generated by the quantum circuit with a "brick-wall" configuration shown Fig. 1 that consists of random unitary operators and generalized measurements. In Fig. 1 , the <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> qudit chain is along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> direction while the vertical direction represents time (or discrete time steps). Each green block represents an <span class="math inline">\(i n-\)</span> dependently Haar-random two-site unitary gate that acts on a pair of neighbouring sites in the <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> qudit chain. Each of the blue blocks represents a one-site gen- eralized measurement. Such generalized measurements can be most conveniently described using the language of quantum channels [44,50] , which we review in the following.</p>
<p>用quantum channels 的语言来描述通用的measurements</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>用Kraus operators 描述trace-preserving迹保留映射</li>
<li>归一化调节normalization condition</li>
<li>quantum channel 可以看成 “概率演化”</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, a quantum channel is a completely positive trace-preserving map, which can be described by a set <span class="math inline">\(M =\left\{M_{\alpha}\right\}\)</span> of Kraus operators <span class="math inline">\(M_{\alpha}\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=1,2, \ldots) .\)</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Kraus operators are normalized according to a generalized normalization condition <span class="math display">\[
\sum_{M_{\alpha} \in M } w\left(M_{\alpha}\right) M_{\alpha}^{\dagger} M_{\alpha}= 1
\]</span> with</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(w\left(M_{\alpha}\right)\)</span> a non-negative real number for each Kraus operator $M_{} M $</li>
<li>which is the weight of realizing <span class="math inline">\(M_{\alpha}\)</span> in the quantum channel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The left hand side of this normalization condition can be viewed as the weighted sum of <span class="math inline">\(M_{\alpha}^{\dagger} M_{\alpha}\)</span> 's with non-negative weights <span class="math inline">\(w\left(M_{\alpha}\right) .\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>In the following, we will denote this weighted sum as <span class="math inline">\(E _{M_{\alpha} \in M }\)</span>. For example, we can rewrite the generalized normalization condition as <span class="math display">\[
E _{M_{\alpha} \in M } M_{\alpha}^{\dagger} M_{\alpha}=\sum_{M_{\alpha} \in M } w\left(M_{\alpha}\right) M_{\alpha}^{\dagger} M_{\alpha}= 1
\]</span> Given the set <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and the weights, the quantum channel is defined as the map from any density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(E _{M_{\alpha} \in M } M_{\alpha} \rho M_{\alpha}^{\dagger} .\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>In fact, in the standard definition of the Kraus operators and their normalization (see [50] for example), the weights <span class="math inline">\(w\left(M_{\alpha}\right)\)</span> are all taken to be 1 . Here, we have made a generalization to non-unity weights and to the corresponding weighted sum for the convenience of later discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the set <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (and the weights of the Kraus operators), the quantum channel can also be <strong>understood as a "probabilistic evolution".</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If one starts with a pure quantum state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle,\)</span></li>
<li>for every Kraus operator <span class="math inline">\(M_{\alpha} \in\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(M ,\)</span> the quantum channel evolves <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{M_{\alpha}|\psi\rangle}{\| M_{\alpha}|\psi\rangle \|}\)</span> with a probability of <span class="math inline">\(w\left(M_{\alpha}\right) \| M_{\alpha}|\psi\rangle \|^{2}=w\left(M_{\alpha}\right)\left\langle\psi\left|M_{\alpha}^{\dagger} M_{\alpha}\right| \psi\right\rangle\)</span></li>
<li>Note that this probability is normalized due to the generalized normalization condition of the Kraus operators.</li>
<li>Since we only consider one-site generalized measurements in the quantum circuit shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1,\)</span> we then restrict the Kraus operators in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to be localized on the site where the corresponding blue block is acting on.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>例子：用quantum channels 的语言来描述通用的measurements可以简单覆盖projective measurement.</p>
<p>The quantum channel description of generalized measurements can easily recover the standard projective measurement. For example,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the one-site projective measurement with respect to a (orthonormal) set of basis vec-tors <span class="math inline">\(|i\rangle\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2, \ldots, d)\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> dimensional local Hilbert space on a given site can be described by the quantum channel with the set of Kraus operators <span class="math inline">\(M _{1}=\left\{P_{1}, P_{2}, \ldots, P_{d}\right\}\)</span> and the weights <span class="math inline">\(w\left(P_{i}\right)=1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2, \ldots, d\)</span>.</li>
<li>Here, <span class="math inline">\(P_{i}=|i\rangle\langle i|\)</span> is the projection operator on the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> th basis vector. The quantum channel with the set <span class="math inline">\(M _{1}\)</span> evolves (or collapses) a pure state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{P_{i}|\psi\rangle}{\| P_{i}|\psi\rangle \mid}\)</span> with a probability of <span class="math inline">\(w\left(P_{i}\right) \| P_{i}|\psi\rangle\left\|^{2}=\right\| P_{i}|\psi\rangle \|^{2}\)</span>, which is as expected for the standard projective measurement.</li>
</ol>
<p>通用测量 generalized measurements 与测量概率</p>
<p>Using the language of quantum channels, one can study more generalized forms of measurements. Ref. 41 and Ref. 43 studied quantum circuits with <span class="math inline">\(d=2\)</span> in similar configurations as Fig. 1 in which a quantum state, when it encounters a blue block in the quantum circuit,</p>
<ul>
<li>undergoes a standard one-site projective measurement with a classical probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span></li>
<li>and stays intact with a classical probability <span class="math inline">\(1-p\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario, the associated quantum channel is described by the set of Kraus operators <span class="math display">\[
M _{p}=\left\{ 1 , P_{1}, P_{2}, \ldots, P_{d}\right\}
\]</span> equipped with</p>
<ul>
<li>the weights <span class="math inline">\(w( 1 )=1-p\)</span></li>
<li>and <span class="math inline">\(w\left(P_{i}\right)=p\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2, \ldots, d .\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In the following sections, we also study this type of generalized measurement (or quantum channel) given by the set of Kraus operators <span class="math inline">\(M _{p}\)</span> and the corresponding weights given above. We would also like to introduce a closely related generalized measurement given by the set of Kraus operators <span class="math inline">\(M _{p}^{\prime}=\{ 1 \} \cup\left\{\sqrt{d} P_{U} \mid U \in U (d)\right\}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(P_{U} \equiv U^{\dagger} P_{1} U,\)</span> which is an (uncountable) infinite set. The subset <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\sqrt{d} P_{U} \mid U \in U (d)\right\}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(M _{p}^{\prime}\)</span> is continuously parameterized by a (one-site) unitary matrix <span class="math inline">\(U \in U (d) .\)</span> The weight on the operator <span class="math inline">\(1 \in M _{p}^{\prime}\)</span> is still <span class="math inline">\(1-p,\)</span> which has the same physical interpretation as the weight of the operator <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(M _{p} .\)</span> The weight on the infinite subset <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\sqrt{d} P_{U} \mid U \in U (d)\right\}\)</span> is naturally given by the Haar measure: <span class="math inline">\(w\left(\sqrt{d} P_{U}\right)=p d U\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d U\)</span> represents the Haar measure on <span class="math inline">\(U (d),\)</span> normalized such that $_{U U (d)} d U 1 =1 $ . The weighted sum of Kraus operators in <span class="math inline">\(M _{p}^{\prime}\)</span> is defined accordingly. For example, the generalized normalization condition of Kraus operator is given by <span class="math inline">\(E _{M \in M _{p}^{\prime}} M^{\dagger} M=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\((1-p) 1 ^{\dagger} 1 +p \int_{U \in U (d)} d U\left(\sqrt{d} P_{U}\right)^{\dagger}\left(\sqrt{d} P_{U}\right)= 1 .\)</span> The relation between the generalized measurements defined by <span class="math inline">\(M _{p}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M _{p}^{\prime}\)</span> will be studied in the following section.</p>
<p>在我们专注于广义测量的具体选择之前，让我们重新表述一下本文中我们感兴趣的量子电路的构造</p>
<p>Before we focus on a specific choice of generalized measurements, let us rephrase the construction of the quantum circuit of interest to us in this paper using the quantum-channel language we introduced above. In a random quantum circuit of the configuration shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1,\)</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>each green block is an independently Haarrandom two-site unitary gate that acts on a pair of neighboring sites in the <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> qudit chain.</li>
<li>Each of the blue blocks is independently and randomly drawn from the ensemble given by the set of Kraus operators <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (and the associated weights) that is associated with the generalized measurement one wants to study.</li>
</ol>
<p>For each realization of the green and blue blocks, we can built a random quantum circuit, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, following Fig. 1.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Such a quantum circuit evolves an initial pure state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> qudit chain to the pure state <span class="math inline">\(\frac{C|\psi\rangle}{\| C|\psi\rangle \|} .\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The probability for this evolution to occur is the product of three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>the norm <span class="math inline">\(\| C|\psi\rangle \|^{2}=\left\langle\psi\left|C^{\dagger} C\right| \psi\right\rangle=\operatorname{Tr}\left(C|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| C^{\dagger}\right)\)</span>,</li>
<li>the weight for each Kraus operator in each blue block,</li>
<li>and (iii) the Haar-measure probability for realizing each random two-site unitary gates in each green block.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Ref. <span class="math inline">\(51,\)</span> the evolution from <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{C|\psi\rangle}{\| C|\psi\rangle \|}\)</span> is also referred as to a quantum trajectory. Different realizations of the random quantum circuit <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> lead to different quantum trajectories.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="average">average</h4>
<p>We are interested in the average quantum dynamics induced by this random quantum circuit. We denote the average over all realizations of the random quantum circuit as <span class="math inline">\(E _{C} \cdots\)</span>. The precise meaning of <span class="math inline">\(E _{C}\)</span> is the following.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, for each two-site random unitary gate (green block), <span class="math inline">\(E _{C}\)</span> contains an independent integration over the Haar measure (of the <span class="math inline">\(U \left(d^{2}\right)\)</span> group).</li>
<li>This integration will be denoted as <span class="math inline">\(E _{U}\)</span> in the following. For each generalized measurement (blue block), <span class="math inline">\(E _{C}\)</span> includes the weighted sum over the set of Kraus operators, <span class="math inline">\(E _{ M },\)</span> as explained before One example of an averaged quantity under the quantum dynamics induced by this random quantum circuit is the averaged expectation value <span class="math inline">\(\overline{ O }\)</span> of an observable <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> in the state obtained from evolving the initial state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> by the random quantum circuit:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\overline{ O } &amp;=\underset{C}{ E }\left(\frac{\left\langle\psi\left|C^{\dagger} O C\right| \psi\right\rangle}{\| C|\psi\rangle \|^{2}} \times \operatorname{Tr}\left(C|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| C^{\dagger}\right)\right) \\
&amp;=\underset{C}{ E }\left\langle\psi\left|C^{\dagger} O C\right| \psi\right\rangle
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\frac{\left\langle\psi\left|C^{\dagger} O C\right| \psi\right\rangle}{\| C|\psi\rangle \|^{2}}\)</span> is the quantum mechanical expectation value of the observable <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> in the state <span class="math inline">\(\frac{C|\psi\rangle}{\| C|\psi\rangle \|},\)</span></li>
<li>and the factor <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Tr}\left(C|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| C^{\dagger}\right)\)</span> is, as explained, one of the factors in the probability of the corresponding quantum trajectory.</li>
</ul>
<p>We see that Eq. 1 <span class="math inline">\(\overline{ O }=\underset{C}{ E }\)</span> naturally agrees with the evolution of an observable <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> under a quantum channel (constructed from Fig. 1 by viewing each of the green and blue blocks as a quantum channel).</p>
<h4 id="the-averaged-dynamics-of-subsystem-entanglements">the (averaged) dynamics of subsystem entanglements</h4>
<p>The more interesting quantity we want to study is the (averaged) dynamics of subsystem entanglements under the random quantum circuit. Consider a subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and its complement <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span> of the 1D qudit chain. The <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th Rényi entropy <span class="math inline">\(S_{n, A}[|\psi\rangle]\)</span> on the subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of a pure state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span> follows the standard definition: <span class="math display">\[
S_{n, A}[|\psi\rangle]=\frac{1}{1-n} \log \operatorname{Tr}_{A}\left(\rho_{A}^{n}\right)
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A}=\operatorname{Tr}_{\bar{A}}|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\)</span> is the reduced density matrix on the subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</li>
<li>Here, <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Tr}_{A}\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Tr}_{\bar{A}}\)</span> ) represents the partial trace over the degrees of freedom in the subsys<span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{tem} A(\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}) .\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, <span class="math inline">\(S_{n, A}[|\psi\rangle]\)</span> can be expressed in terms of the expectation value of a permutation operator <span class="math inline">\(S _{n, A}\)</span> acting on the the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -fold replicated state as <span class="math display">\[
S_{n, A}[|\psi\rangle]=\frac{1}{1-n} \log \operatorname{Tr}\left((|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|)^{\otimes n} S _{n, A}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S _{n, A}\)</span> depends on the choice of entanglement region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and is defined as <span class="math display">\[
S _{n, A}=\prod_{x} X _{g_{x}} 
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
g_{x}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}

<p><span class="math inline">\(g_{x}\)</span> labels the permutation on site <span class="math inline">\(x,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X _{g_{x}}=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{[i]}\left|i_{g_{x}(1)} i_{g_{x}(2)} \cdots i_{g_{x}(n)}\right\rangle\left\langle i_{1} i_{2} \cdots i_{n}\right|\)</span> is its representation on the replicated on-site Hilbert space, i.e. on its <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -fold tensor product [63]. Here, as indicated in the equation above, <span class="math inline">\(g_{x}\)</span> is the cyclic (identity) permutation when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is in the region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is in the region <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span> ). We are interested in the averaged <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th Rényi entropy <span class="math inline">\(\bar{S}_{n, A}\)</span> of the final state after the random quantum circuit evolution: <span class="math display">\[

<h4 id="replica-trick">replica trick</h4>
<p>This <strong>replica trick</strong> was introduced in Ref. 1 in the context of random tensor networks, and in Ref. 38 for random unitary circuits. In this double replica scheme, the total number of replica is <span class="math inline">\(Q=n m+1,\)</span> and the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0\)</span> corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 1 .\)</span> As can be seen from Eq. (6), the additional replica apart from <span class="math inline">\(n m\)</span> originated from the probability <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Tr}\left(C|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| C^{\dagger}\right)\)</span> of obtaining a measurement outcome. As a side comment, if we re-weight this probability by a power <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> i.e. replacing <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Tr}\left(C|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| C^{\dagger}\right) \rightarrow \operatorname{Tr}\left(C|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| C^{\dagger}\right)^{q},\)</span> we could also realize other replica limits <span class="math inline">\(Q=m n+q \rightarrow q\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0\)</span>. To evaluate Eq. (6), we will need to calculate the ensemble average <span class="math inline">\(E _{C} C^{\otimes Q} \otimes C^{\dagger \otimes Q}\)</span> of the tensor product of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> copies of the random quantum circuit <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> copies of its conjugate <span class="math inline">\(C^{\dagger} .\)</span> In the next section, we will show that the calculation of the average <span class="math inline">\(E _{C} C^{\otimes Q} \otimes C^{\dagger \otimes Q}\)</span> can be mapped onto a statistical mechanics model in <span class="math inline">\(2+0\)</span> dimensions.

<p>As we average over all two-site unitary gates in the circuit, the partition function will break up into a product of independent contributions from the generalized measurements. Each generalized measurement is associated with the following partition function weight</p>

<p>In connection with the original network geometry of the random circuit in Fig. 1, the vertical (dotted) links on the honeycomb lattice represent the Weingarten functions which originated from averaging the two-site unitary gates, and the zigzag (solid) links keep track of the contributions from the generalized measurements. In the following, we will refer to the model described by Eq. (16) as the " <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span> model". A similar statistical mechanics model was first derived in Ref. 38 for Haar random unitary circuits without projective measurements (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(p=0\)</span> ). Here we generalized the model to the case with projective measurement.</p>
<p>We note a crucial symmetry property of the statistical mechanics model that will become important in our discussion below, arising from the following symmetry of the local weights <span class="math inline">\(W_{p}\left(g_{i}^{-1} g_{j}\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Wg _{d^{2}}\left(g_{i}^{-1} g_{j}\right)\)</span> which enter the partition function in Eq. (16): They are invariant under global right- and left-multiplication of all group elements <span class="math display">\[
g_{i} \rightarrow h_{L} g_{i} h_{R}^{-1}, g_{j} \rightarrow h_{L} g_{j} h_{R}^{-1}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(h_{L}, h_{R} \in S_{Q}\)</span></p>
<p>This invariance follows from the fact that the Weingarten function in Eq. (11) as well as the 'cycle-counting function' which appears in Eq. (15) and assigns to each permutation <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> the number of its cycles <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span>, are both 'class functions' (i.e. depend only the conjugacy class of the permutation group element).</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span> 'spins' on the boundary, which are permutation group elements <span class="math inline">\(g_{x} \in S_{Q}\)</span> for boundary sites <span class="math inline">\(x,\)</span> are pinned by the boundary condition, which is specified by the entanglement region <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as follows: <span class="math display">\[
g_{x}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
g_{ SWAP } \equiv(12 \cdots n)^{\otimes m}, &amp; x \in A, \\
\text { identity }=e, &amp; x \in \bar{A}
\end{array}\right.
\]</span> This equation follows from Eq. (4) by taking into account the <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> replica which arise, as discussed above, in addition to the Rényi replica from rewriting averages of the logarithm. By tuning the probability of measurement <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, we can change the couplings on the solid links and drive, as we will see, an entanglement transition. As will be shown below, this measurement-induced transition can be naturally interpreted as a simple symmetry-breaking transition of the statistical mechanics model.</p>
<h4 id="potts-model-as-limit">Potts model as limit</h4>
<p>In the limit where the on-site Hilbert space dimension <span class="math inline">\(d=\infty\)</span> is infinite, the <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span> model turns out to reduce to a Potts model with <span class="math inline">\(Q !\)</span> colors. To see this, we evaluate the partition function weight <span class="math inline">\(J_{p}\left(g_{i}, g_{j} ; g_{k}\right)\)</span> associated with each down triangle (in yellow) in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2( a )\)</span>,</p>

</figure>
<p>The partition function in Eq. (16) can be equivalently written in terms of the triangle weight <span class="math inline">\(J_{p}\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[
Z _{A}=\sum_{\left\{g_{i} \in S_{Q}\right\}} \prod_{\langle i j k\rangle \in \nabla} J_{p}\left(g_{i}, g_{j} ; g_{k}\right)
\]</span> subject to the boundary condition that <span class="math inline">\(g_{i}\)</span> should match <span class="math inline">\(g_{x}\)</span> as specified in Eq. (18) on the boundary. Note that positivity of this weight is not guaranteed in general. For example <span class="math display">\[
J_{p=0}((123),(132) ; e)=-2\left(d^{2}-1\right) /\left(d^{6}+d^{4}- 4 d^{2}-4\right)&lt;0
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[ (for any realistic on-site Hilbert space dimension $d \geq 2$ ). This makes the statistical mechanics non-unitary, which is not an issue for our approach, as the field theory describing the entanglement transition is necessarily non-unitary in any case because of the replica limit (see below). In the $d \rightarrow \infty$ limit, we obtain
\]</span> \begin{aligned} W_{p}(g) &amp;=d^{Q}((1-p) <em>{g}+p) \ Wg </em>{d^{2}}(g) &amp;=d^{-2 Q} <em>{g} \end{aligned} <span class="math display">\[
where $\delta_{g}$ is the delta function that gives 1 if and only if $g=e$ is the identity element in the permutation group $S_{Q},$ and gives 0 otherwise. A detailed derivation of Eq. (21) can be found in Appendix A. Substituting Eq. (21) into Eq. $(19),$ the triangle weight reduces to
\]</span> J</em>{p}(g_{i}, g_{j} ; g_{k})=((1-p) <em>{g</em>{i}^{-1} g_{k}}+p)((1-p) <em>{g</em>{j}^{-1} g_{k}}+p) $$ which further factorizes into partition function weights defined separately on the bonds <span class="math inline">\(\langle i k\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\langle j k\rangle .\)</span> The partition function weight across the bond <span class="math inline">\(\langle i k\rangle\)</span> equals 1 if <span class="math inline">\(g_{i}=g_{k}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(g_{i} \neq g_{k}\)</span>, and an analogous weight is assigned to the bond <span class="math inline">\(\langle j k\rangle .\)</span> If we treat each on-site group element <span class="math inline">\(g_{i} \in S_{Q}\)</span> as a state (color) in a spin model, the partition function weight in Eq. (22) precisely matches that of a <span class="math inline">\(Q !\)</span> -state Potts model on a square lattice, whose links are between sites <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k,\)</span> and between sites <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in each unit cell, as displayed in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2( b ) .\)</span> By tuning the measurement rate <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the partition function <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A}\)</span> in Eq. (20) undergoes a phase transition from the ordered phase (small <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> ) to the disordered phase (large <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> ) which we will analyze in detail below.</p>
<p>Away from the <span class="math inline">\(d=\infty\)</span> limit, the weight <span class="math inline">\(W_{p}(g)\)</span> receives the following leading corrections <span class="math inline">\(W_{p}(g)=d^{Q}\left((1-p) \delta_{g}+\right.\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\left.p+\frac{1-p}{d} \delta_{g}^{\prime}+ O \left(d^{-2}\right)\right),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{g}^{\prime}=1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a transposition such as e.g. (12), and <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{g}^{\prime}=0\)</span> otherwise. The Weingarten function will not receive corrections at <span class="math inline">\(1 / d\)</span> order. Using these results, the triangle weight can be evaluated to the <span class="math inline">\(1 / d\)</span> order (see Appendix A for details), yielding <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
J_{p}\left(g_{i}, g_{j} ; g_{k}\right)=&amp;\left((1-p) \delta_{g_{i}^{-1} g_{k}}+p\right)\left((1-p) \delta_{g_{j}^{-1} g_{k}}+p\right) \\
+&amp; \frac{1-p}{d}\left((1-p) \delta_{g_{i}^{-1} g_{j}}^{\prime}\left(\delta_{g_{i}^{-1} g_{k}}+\delta_{g_{j}^{-1} g_{k}}\right)\right.\\
&amp;\left.\quad+p\left(\delta_{g_{i}^{-1} g_{k}}^{\prime}+\delta_{g_{j}^{-1} g_{k}}^{\prime}\right)\right)+ O \left(d^{-2}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Moreover, up to this order, we find that the weights of the <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span> model factorize into a product of weights associated with bonds of the same square lattice, depicted in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2( b )\)</span>, that appears in the <span class="math inline">\(d=\infty\)</span> result <span class="math inline">\((22) .\)</span> Denoting the local weight on the bond <span class="math inline">\(\langle i k\rangle\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(e^{-E\left(g_{i}, g_{k}\right)}\)</span>, the energy function reads (see Appendix A) <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
E\left(g_{i}, g_{k}\right) 
=-\log \left[p+(1-p)\left(\delta_{g_{i}^{-1} g_{k}}+\frac{1}{d} \delta_{g_{i}^{-1} g_{k}}^{\prime}\right)+ O \left(d^{-2}\right)\right]
\end{array}
\]</span> We see that, among all the domain walls, the <span class="math inline">\(1 / d\)</span> corrections favor energetically transposition domain walls in our model, Eq. (20). this will turn out to have important consequences in the following. Crucially, these <span class="math inline">\(1 / d\)</span> corrections break the artificially large <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> symmetry of the weights Eq. (22) of the <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow \infty\)</span> limit to the <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q} \times S_{Q}\)</span> symmetry present for finite <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Consequences of this reduction of symmetry by the <span class="math inline">\(1 / d\)</span> corrections will be further analyzed below.</p>
<h2 id="共形不变">4 共形不变</h2>
<p>Now that we have mapped the calculation of the entanglement entropies of the random circuit with projective measurements onto a (replica) statistical mechanics model, many qualitative features of the entanglement transition can be understood naturally. Our discussion follows closely Ref. 1 where a similar statistical mechanics model was found to describe entanglement transitions in random tensor networks.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>At small <span class="math inline">\(p,\)</span> the Boltzmann weights give a ferromagnetic interaction favoring group elements ('spins') on neighboring sites to be equal,
<ul>
<li>and we thus expect an <strong>ordered phase</strong> of the statistical mechanics model.</li>
<li>In that phase, the free energy cost <span class="math inline">\(F_{A}-F_{\emptyset}\)</span> in Eq. (9) associated with "twisting" the entanglement region scales with the size <span class="math inline">\(L_{A}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> at long times (many layers in the circuit),</li>
<li>corresponding to <strong>volume-law</strong> entanglement <span class="math inline">\(\bar{S}_{n, A} \sim L_{A}\)</span> for sufficiently deep circuits (in the long-time limit <span class="math inline">\(t \rightarrow \infty)\)</span>. This is clearly the behavior expected without measurement, i.e. at <span class="math inline">\(p=0 .\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>As the measurement rate <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> gets closer to <span class="math inline">\(1,\)</span> the <strong>effective temperature</strong> of the statistical mechanics model is increased,
<ul>
<li>leading to a disordered phase.</li>
<li>The domain wall condensate present in this phase can freely absorb the domain wall at the boundaries of the entanglement interval, such that, for a distance exceeding the correlation length from the boundary, there is no additional free energy cost from the boundary domain.</li>
<li>In this limit, the free-energy cost of the boundary domain will scale like the boundary of <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> corresponding to <strong>area-law</strong> scaling of entanglement <span class="math inline">\(\bar{S}_{n, A} \sim\)</span> const.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The entanglement transition separating these two phases therefore corresponds to an ordering transition in the statistical mechanics model.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In general, assuming that the <strong>transition is of second order</strong>, it should be described a by two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory <span class="math inline">\(( CFT )\)</span> with central charge <span class="math inline">\(c=0\)</span> in the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 1 .\)</span></li>
<li>(Recall that <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> measures the way the free energy changes when a finite scale is introduced; since here the partition function <span class="math inline">\(Z _{\emptyset}=1\)</span> is trivial in the replica limit, we have <span class="math inline">\(c=0 .\)</span> ) Such CFTs at central charge <span class="math inline">\(c=0\)</span> are non-unitary, and are notoriously hard to tackle even in two dimensions.</li>
<li>Below we will propose a way to approach this transition from the infinite on-site Hilbert space size <span class="math inline">\(d=\infty\)</span> limit. Even without identifying the underlying CFT precisely, there are important consequences that can be deduced from conformal invariance alone.</li>
<li>First of all, since the bulk properties of the transition only depend on <span class="math inline">\(Q,\)</span> the location of the bulk transition point at <span class="math inline">\(p=p_{c}\)</span> as well as all bulk critical exponents are the same for all Rényi entropies in the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 1 .\)</span> (The Rényi entropies arise from observables located at the boundary of the system.)</li>
<li>Our statistical model thus <strong>naturally explains</strong> why all Rényi entropies with <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span> have a transition at the same value of <span class="math inline">\(p_{c}\)</span>. (This was observed numerically in Ref. [41].)</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, conformal invariance implies a dynamical critical exponent <span class="math inline">\(z=1\)</span>, so the scaling with time and space should be the same at the entanglement transition. To analyze the scaling of the entanglement entropy at the critical point, we note that the ratio of partition functions <span class="math inline">\(Z _{A} / Z _{\emptyset}\)</span> that appears in Eq. (9) , corresponds in the CFT language to the two-point function of a boundary condition changing <span class="math inline">\(( BCC )\)</span> operator <span class="math inline">\([53,54] \phi_{ BCC }:\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
Z _{A} / Z _{\emptyset}=\left\langle\phi_{ BCC }\left(L_{A}\right) \phi_{ BCC }(0)\right\rangle
\]</span> where the operators are inserted at the boundary of the entanglement interval <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Near criticality, this two point function scales as <span class="math display">\[
\sim 1 / L_{A}^{2 h(n, m)} f_{n, m}\left(L_{A} / \xi_{Q}\right)
\]</span> with</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\xi_{Q} \sim\left|p-p_{c}(Q)\right|^{-\nu(Q)}\)</span> the correlation length of the statistical mechanics model</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f_{n, m}\)</span> are universal scaling functions that depend on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> independently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugging this expression into the replica formula (9), we find the general scaling of the entanglement entropy <span class="math display">\[
\bar{S}_{n, A}=\left.\frac{2}{n-1} \frac{\partial h}{\partial m}\right|_{m=0} \log L_{A}+f_{n}\left(\frac{L_{A}}{\xi}\right),
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\xi \sim\left|p-p_{c}\right|^{-\nu}\)</span> the correlation length in the limit <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 1\)</span>. In particular, conformal invariance predicts that <span class="math inline">\(\bar{S}_{n, A} \sim \log L_{A}\)</span> at criticality <span class="math inline">\(p=p_{c},\)</span> with a universal prefactor that depends on the Rényi index <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Note that eq. (26) holds up to additive non-universal constants - in order to isolate the universal contributions, one can also take the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{S}_{n, A}\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\log L_{A} .\)</span> This scaling form is in good agreement with the numerical observations of Refs. 41,42,44 .</p>
<p>The BCC operator <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{ BCC }\)</span> can also be used to derive the scaling of the mutual information of two regions</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\left[x_{1}, x_{2}\right]\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(B=\left[x_{3}, x_{4}\right]\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I_{A, B}^{n}=\bar{S}_{n, A}+\bar{S}_{n, B}-\bar{S}_{n, A \cup B}
\]</span></p>
<p>which maps naturally onto the 4 -point function of <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{ BCC }\)</span>. As a result of conformal invariance, we find that the mutual information at criticality should depend only on the cross ratio [55] <span class="math display">\[
I _{A, B}^{n}=g_{n}(\eta) \text { with } \eta=\frac{x_{12} x_{34}}{x_{13} x_{24}}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x_{i j}=\frac{L}{\pi} \sin \frac{\pi}{L}\left|x_{i}-x_{j}\right|\)</span> for a system of size <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> with periodic boundary conditions. This scaling was checked numerically for Clifford unitary circuits in Ref. <span class="math inline">\(44 .\)</span></p>
<h2 id="渗流极限">5 渗流极限</h2>
<p>As we have shown above, the Boltzmann weights of the statistical model in the limit of infinite onsite Hilbert space dimension <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow \infty\)</span> take a very simple form Eq. (22). This coincides with the high temperature expansion of a Potts model with <span class="math inline">\(Q !\)</span> states on the square lattice, as an expansion onto the so-called Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters [56] where an edge is occupied with weight <span class="math inline">\(1-p,\)</span> not occupied with weight <span class="math inline">\(p,\)</span> and where each connected cluster (including single sites) carries a weight <span class="math inline">\(Q !-\)</span> the number of Potts states. In the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 1\)</span>, this maps onto a bond percolation problem where <span class="math inline">\(1-p\)</span> is the probability for a bond to be occupied. The partition function is trivial <span class="math inline">\(Z _{\emptyset}=1,\)</span> and the transition occurs for <span class="math inline">\(p_{c}=1 / 2\)</span>. The correlation length diverges as <span class="math inline">\(\xi \sim\left|p-p_{c}\right|^{-4 / 3}\)</span> at the transition <span class="math inline">\([57],\)</span> and the central charge is <span class="math inline">\(c=0\)</span> as expected from general considerations.</p>
<p>As just discussed, we have shown that the entanglement transition driven by projective measurements is in the universality class of <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> percolation <span class="math inline">\((Q \rightarrow 1\)</span> limit of a <span class="math inline">\(Q !\)</span> -Potts model). We note that based on earlier results on random unitary circuits without measurement at infinite on-site Hilbert space dimension [7,38] , and based on the description obtained in Ref. 41 for the zeroth Renyi entropy in terms of a minimal cut classical optimization problem of paths in <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> percolation, it was conjectured in Ref. 41 that if the minimal cut classical optimization problem holds exactly in the projective measurement problem in the limit of infinite Hilbert space dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, then this optimization problem would also describe the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th Renyi entropies with <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span>, and not only the zeroth Renyi entropy <span class="math inline">\(S_{0}\)</span>, with the same result.</p>
<p>While Ref. 41 thus anticipated, based on these previous works, a connection of the projective measurement problem with percolation in the <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow \infty\)</span> limit, there are universal quantities that go beyond this minimal cut picture and which can only be captured using a detailed analysis that relies on our replica trick formulation, as well as on detailed properties of the CFT describing the percolation critical point. In particular, we will show below that the <span class="math inline">\(d=\infty\)</span> limit requires a detailed knowledge of the CFT of <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> percolation, including very recent results [58], rather than merely a geometric "optimization problem" as in Ref. 41 for <span class="math inline">\(S_{0}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, we now provide an exact calculation of the universal prefactor of the logarithm in Eq. (26) in the limit <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. To do so, we need to identify the proper BCC operator in the <span class="math inline">\(Q !\)</span> -state Potts CFT. This is actually a subtle point: Naively, this would appear to be the BCC operator which changes the boundary condition that is fixed to the identity permutation group element, to the boundary condition that is fixed to the "SWAP" group element [2nd line of Eq. (18)] of the <span class="math inline">\(Q !-\)</span> state Potts model in the percolation limit <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 1\)</span>. It is well known that this <span class="math inline">\(BCC\)</span> operator has finite scaling dimension <span class="math inline">\(=1 / 3\)</span> in that limit <span class="math inline">\([53,59,60] .\)</span> This would imply an infinite limit <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0\)</span> for all Rényi entropies in Eq. (9) using a powerlaw in Eq. (25) with a finite decay exponent <span class="math inline">\(=2 \times 1 / 3\)</span> in that limit.</p>
<p>This issue with this naive approach arises because the limit <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow \infty\)</span> was taken implicitly before the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 1\)</span>. To remedy this, the key idea is to "soften" the Boltzmann weights of the statistical mechanics model in the vicinity of the boundary in a small "boundary layer" and replace them by those at a finite value of <span class="math inline">\(1 / d\)</span>. The bulk Boltzmann weights remain at <span class="math inline">\(1 / d=0\)</span>, i.e. they are those of the Potts model. Since the Boltzmann weights of the boundary layer still favor "ferromagnetic" alignment of the <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span> -valued 'spins', the presence of the boundary layer does not modify the bias for boundary 'spins' to align to the SWAP and the identity group elements, respectively, along segments <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span> of the boundary. The effect of the boundary layer is that the 'sharp' domain wall where the group element along the boundary switches directly from identity to SWAP, splits [65] into a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(m(n-1)\)</span> consecutive "elementary" domain walls, each characterized by a single transposition having just one cycle of length two since domain walls with a single transposition are energetically favored by the finite-1/d correction in the energy function Eq. (24). Using eq. Eq. (24), it is straightforward to see that the energy cost of an elementary domain wall is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta E_{\text {elementary }}=\log p^{-1}-\frac{1-p}{p} d^{-1}+ O \left(d^{-2}\right),\)</span> which is lower than the energy cost of the domain wall separating the identity permutation from SWAP, which has energy <span class="math display">\[
\Delta E_{ SWAP }=\log p^{-1}+ O \left(d^{-2}\right) 
\]</span> Note also that the total energy cost of an extended segment of the boundary separating uniform boundary conditions fixed to the identity on one side from uniform boundary conditions fixed to SWAP on the other of this segment, which consists of asequence of <span class="math inline">\(m(n-1)\)</span> consecutive domain walls (whose group theory product must be equal to the SWAP group element), is also less than the cost of a 'sharp' SWAP domain wall located on a single boundary link, since <span class="math display">\[
m(n-1) \Delta E_{\text {elementary }} \ll \Delta E_{\text {SWAP }}
\]</span> in the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0\)</span>. Moreover, since the energy cost <span class="math inline">\(\Delta E_{\text {elementary of }}\)</span> a single transposition domain wall on a given boundary link is lower than that of a domain wall on the same link characterized by any other non-identity permutation [using Eq. (24)], the sharp SWAP domain wall localized at a single boundary link will split into <span class="math inline">\(m(n-1)\)</span> elementary domains walls, each localized on one of the <span class="math inline">\(m(n-1)\)</span> boundary links.</p>
<p>While the so-defined <span class="math inline">\((n-1) m\)</span> elementary domain walls in the <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> Potts model can branch and touch each other, they are well-known and well-defined objects in the <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> Potts model, called 'thin' domain walls, whose properties have recently been studied in great detail [58]. In our context the corresponding 'split' BCC operator inserts <span class="math inline">\(\ell=m(n-1)\)</span> 'thin' domain walls in the Potts theory. Using the results of Ref. <span class="math inline">\(58,\)</span> we find that the relevant <span class="math inline">\(BCC\)</span> operator is <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{ BCC }=\Phi_{2 \ell-1,4 \ell-1},\)</span> using standard CFT notations <span class="math inline">\([55][66] .\)</span> Now, the <span class="math inline">\(Q !\)</span> -state Potts model is described by a CFT [57,61] with central charge <span class="math inline">\(c=1-\frac{6}{x(x+1)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x=\frac{\pi}{\arccos \frac{\sqrt{Q !}}{2}}-1 .\)</span> The scaling dimension of the boundary operator <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{r, s}\)</span> is then <span class="math inline">\(h_{r, s}=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\frac{((x+1) r-s x)^{2}-1}{4 x(x+1)} .\)</span> The critical exponent <span class="math inline">\(h_{2 \ell-1,4 \ell-1}\)</span> vanishes as <span class="math inline">\(\ell=m(n-1) \rightarrow 0\)</span> in the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0,\)</span> as it should, and yields <span class="math inline">\(\lim _{m \rightarrow 0} h_{2 \ell-1,4 \ell-1} /(n-1) m=1 / 6 .\)</span> In the replica limit, Eq. (26) therefore yields (for periodic spatial boundary conditions) <span class="math display">\[
\bar{S}_{n, A}=\frac{1}{3} \log L_{A}+\ldots
\]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th Rényi entropies <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span> at criticality in the limit <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. We remark that our replica statistical mechanics model only describes Rényi entropies with index <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1,\)</span> as quantities such as the domain wall free energy all change sign at <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>. While, as already mentioned above, Ref. 41 anticipated, based on previous works, a connection of the projective measurement problem with percolation in the <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow \infty\)</span> limit, we emphasize that the universal prefactor in eq. (28) goes beyond the geometric 'minimal cut' path optimization picture found in Ref. 41 to describe the zeroth Rényi entropy, and indicates a different behavior of the Rényi entropies <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1 .\)</span> We also note that the universal prefactor in (28) is not purely a property of the <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> percolation <span class="math inline">\(CFT ,\)</span> as it depends on how this CFT is approached in the replica limit <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0\)</span> see (26) .</p>
<p>We end by commenting that the same expression for the universal coefficient of the logarithm of subsystem size can be obtained in the Random Tensor Network model of Ref. <span class="math inline">\(1,\)</span> when fine-tuned to the percolation critical point.</p>
<h2 id="有限维度希尔伯特空间的通用纠缠相变">6 有限维度希尔伯特空间的通用纠缠相变</h2>
<p>In closing, we briefly comment on the CFT describing of the generic entanglement transition at finite Hilbert space dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. While the percolation limit <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow \infty\)</span> provides an in essence completely analytically tractable picture of the projective measurement-induced entanglement transition, this limit is not generic. The Potts model which is obtained in the limit <span class="math inline">\(d \rightarrow \infty\)</span> has a symmetry <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span>, which is much larger than the <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q} \times S_{Q}\)</span> symmetry (corresponding to left/right multiplication) of the model (16) describing finite <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. The leading operator in the <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> Potts model that breaks the symmetry down to <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q} \times S_{Q}\)</span> was identified in Ref. 1 as the so-called twohull operator of the Potts model. In the replica percolation limit <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 1\)</span>, this operator has scaling dimension <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{2-\text { hull }}=\frac{5}{4}&lt;2\)</span> so it is relevant. (In fact, it turns out that this is the only Renormalization Group relevant operator that can appear at the percolation fixed point, when the symmetry is broken to <span class="math inline">\(\left.S_{Q} \times S_{Q} .\right)\)</span> We therefore expect the finite <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> entanglement transition to be described by a different CFT, obtained as the IR fixed point of percolation perturbed by a two-hull operator. More precisely, let us work with the Landau-Ginzburg formulation of the <span class="math inline">\(Q !\)</span> -state Potts field theory in terms of the Potts order parameter field <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{a}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a=1, \ldots, Q !\)</span> ! and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{a} \phi_{a}=0 .\)</span> The leading perturbation implementing the symmetry breaking <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !} \longrightarrow S_{Q} \times S_{Q}\)</span> is given by [1] <span class="math display">\[
L = L _{\text {Potts }}+\sum_{a, b \in S_{Q}} W\left(a^{-1} b\right) \phi_{a} \phi_{b}+\ldots
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is a class function of the permutation group <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span>. Crucially the labels <span class="math inline">\(a, b\)</span> are now interpreted as elements of the group <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span>. The only allowed function <span class="math inline">\(W\left(a^{-1} b\right)\)</span> that would respect the <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !}\)</span> symmetry is <span class="math inline">\(W\left(a^{-1} b\right)=\delta_{a, b},\)</span> but any class function of <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q}\)</span> is enough to satisfy the <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q} \times S_{Q}\)</span> symmetry. The fate of this perturbed Potts model in the IR is currently unknown. However, we note that this field theory has exactly the same form as the one obtained for entanglement transitions in bulk random tensor networks in Ref. 1 , as they both correspond to the symmetry breaking <span class="math inline">\(S_{Q !} \longrightarrow S_{Q} \times S_{Q} .\)</span> It is therefore tempting to conjecture that they correspond to the same bulk universality class, although we caution that the two transitions correspond to different replica limits; <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q \rightarrow 0\)</span> respectively, for the projective measurement transition studied in this work and for random tensor networks, respectively. In both cases, <span class="math inline">\(Q ! \rightarrow 1\)</span> in the replica limit, so both problems correspond to a percolation theory perturbed by a 2 -hull operator. However, the different replica limits will likely yield different (trivial) prefactors, e.g. in Eq. (26).</p>
<h2 id="结论">结论</h2>
<p>We have derived an exact statistical mechanics model description of the entanglement transition that occurs in random unitary circuits with projective measurements <span class="math inline">\([41,42] .\)</span> Our approach relies on a replica trick that allows us to average entanglement entropies over the realizations of the random circuits and measurements, and to deal with the intrinsic non-linearities of the projective measurement problem. Our work naturally explains the emergence of conformal invariance at the entanglement transition, and predicts specific scaling forms for the entanglement entropy and mutual information. In the limit of infinite Hilbert space dimension <span class="math inline">\(d=\infty,\)</span> we find that the transition is in the percolation universality class, and we computed the exact value of the universal coefficient of the logarithm of subsystem size in the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th Rényi entropies for <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span>. This limit also provides a natural starting point to identify the generic entanglement transition at finite Hilbert space dimension <span class="math inline">\(d,\)</span> as a perturbation of percolation by a 2 -hull operator. Identifying the CFT in the generic case remains an challenging task for future work.</p>
