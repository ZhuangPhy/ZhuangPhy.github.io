<p>In this chapter we start to consider the effects of electron-electron interaction. In the case of weak coupling to the electrodes or weak coupling between the parts of the system, the discreteness of electron charge is important and transport is described mainly as a sequence of tunneling events (single-electron tunneling). A competition between tunneling and Coulomb repulsion leads to suppression of the current known as Coulomb blockade.</p>
<p>At the beginning (Sect. <span class="math inline">\(5.1\)</span> ) we introduce the models of electron-electron interaction and important parameters. We introduce the Hubbard-Anderson model taking into account density-density Coulomb repulsion of electrons in different singleparticle states (this model is used later) and more simple constant-interaction model when the energy is dependent only on the full charge of the system. All calculations in this chapter a based on this model.</p>
<p>In the Sects. <span class="math inline">\(5.2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5.3\)</span> we consider Coulomb blockade in the systems with dense energy spectrum (metal grains or large quantum dots). Two basic models are considered: single-electron box and single-electron transistor. The modification of this theory in the case of quantum dots with discrete energy levels is presented in the Sect. 5.4. Cotunneling, which is the tunneling process involving simultaneous transfer of two (or more) electrons, is described briefly in the Sect. <span class="math inline">\(5.5\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="electron-electron-interaction-in-nanosystems">5.1 Electron-Electron Interaction in Nanosystems</h2>
<h3 id="single-electron-tunneling-charging-energy">5.1.1 Single-Electron Tunneling: Charging Energy</h3>
<p>In tunneling through nanosystems, which are weakly coupled to the leads (see below the condition of weak coupling (5.19)), the discreteness of the electronic charge starts to be important. For example, the sequential tunneling assumes that an electron from the left lead jumps into the system, stays here some time, and then jumps into the right lead. In the noninteracting case the probabilities of both processes are determined by the tunneling matrix elements and actual distribution functions of electrons, and are restricted by the Pauli principle only. However, if we include Coulomb interaction between electrons, the situation changes drastically. Even a single electron produces some extra charges just after the tunneling event (Fig.5.1). Coulomb repulsion increases the energy, which is necessary for tunneling into the system, and determines the effective energy levels for additional electrons. As a result, electrons pass through such a system one-by-one (because if the system is occupied by one extra electron, the second one does not have enough energy to go here), and the current is suppressed at low temperatures and low voltages (Coulomb blockade).</p>
<p>Let us start from the case of a relatively large system with dense energy spectrum (it can be a metallic grain or a large quantum dot with many electrons, Fig. 5.1). The energy required to add one electron from the zero-energy level (zero-temperature Fermi-level in the leads) to the system is called addition energy (we assume that in equilibrium the Fermi level in the leads and the quasi-Fermi level in the grain are equal). If only the electrostatic energy is taken into account it is <span class="math display">\[
\Delta E_{N}^{+}(N \rightarrow N+1)=E(N+1)-E(N)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(E(N)\)</span> is the electrostatic energy of a system with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> electrons, which is determined for large enough isolated systems by the capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> : <span class="math display">\[
E(N)=\frac{Q^{2}}{2 C}=\frac{e^{2}\left(N-N_{0}\right)^{2}}{2 C}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(-e N_{0}\)</span> is the ionic positive charge, compensating the electronic charge <span class="math inline">\(e N\)</span>. This approximation is reasonable only for the large number of electrons <span class="math inline">\(N, N_{0} \gg 1\)</span>. The minimal energy required to add one electron to the neutral system is called charging energy <span class="math display">\[
E_{C}=\Delta E_{N_{0}}^{+}\left(N_{0} \rightarrow N_{0}+1\right)=\frac{e^{2}}{2 C}
\]</span> If we want to add the second electron, the addition energy <span class="math display">\[
\Delta E_{N_{0}+1}^{+}\left(N_{0}+1 \rightarrow N_{0}+2\right)=\frac{3 e^{2}}{2 C}
\]</span> is required, and so on. We can say that in this case the discrete energy levels are formed by the Coulomb interaction, in spite of the fact that the initial energy spectrum is dense (quasi-continuous).</p>
<p>The single-electron charging effects are observed not only in transport through small grains, but also in single tunnel junctions (Fig. 5.2).</p>
<p>The charging energy is an important energy scale. Let us estimate it in some typical cases. The classical expression for the capacitance of the usual oxide tunneling junction is <span class="math inline">\(C=\varepsilon S /(4 \pi d)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon \approx 10\)</span> is the dielectric constant of the oxide, <span class="math inline">\(S \approx(100 nm )^{2}\)</span> is the area of the junction, and <span class="math inline">\(d \approx 10 \AA\)</span> is the thickness of the oxide layer. With these typical parameters the capacitance is <span class="math inline">\(C \approx 10^{-15} F\)</span>, which corresponds to the charging energy <span class="math inline">\(E_{C} \approx 10^{-4} eV\)</span> and temperature <span class="math inline">\(T \sim 1 K\)</span>. This means that in metallic junctions the charging effects can be observed at sub-Kelvin temperatures. However, for nanoscale metallic particles, semiconductor quantum dots, and single molecules the charging energy, and corresponding temperature, can be orders of magnitude larger.</p>
<h3 id="discrete-energy-levels">5.1.2 Discrete Energy Levels</h3>
<p>The first important energy scale in small systems is the charging energy <span class="math inline">\(E_{C}\)</span>, the second one is the energy level spacing <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \epsilon\)</span> between the eigenstates of a system. In metallic islands and semiconductor quantum dots the level spacing is determined by the geometrical size, because the discrete energy levels are formed as a result of spatial quantization of quasiparticles. It can be estimated using the free-electron</p>
<p>expression near the Fermi surface. For example, in a 3D system with characteristic size <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> the level spacing can be approximated by <span class="math display">\[
\Delta \epsilon\left(\epsilon_{F}\right) \sim \frac{\pi^{2} \hbar^{2}}{m k_{F} L^{3}}
\]</span> here <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the effective mass, <span class="math inline">\(k_{F}\)</span> is the Fermi wave-vector. In smaller systems, like small quantum dots, multi quantum dot systems, and single molecules, the energy spectrum is more complex and the level spacing (or, more precisely, the energy spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\lambda}\)</span> itself) should be calculated from the microscopic model. In this case the interactions can not be neglected and the level spacing <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \epsilon\)</span> can not be unambiguously distinguished from the charging energy <span class="math inline">\(E_{C} .\)</span> In the limit of small single molecules the charging energy is, in fact, the same as the ionization energy, which in turn is related to the energy spectrum <span class="math inline">\(E(q, \lambda)\)</span> of the isolated molecule, where <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is the charge state, and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the eigenstate in this charge state. Finally, for nanosystems we understand the charging energy as the minimal energy required to add one electron to the neutral system, and the level spacing as the typical energy difference between two levels of the system in the same charge state.</p>
<p>The consideration in this chapter is devoted mostly to the case of the dense energy spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \epsilon \ll E_{C}\)</span>, when the directness of the energy levels can be neglected or taken into account within the simplified models.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to note here, that the last very important energy scale is the temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Both discrete energy spectrum and charging effects can be observed only if the temperature is lower, than the corresponding energy scales <span class="math display">\[
T \ll \Delta \epsilon, \quad T \ll E_{C}
\]</span> ### 5.1.3 Hubbard-Anderson and Constant-Interaction Models</p>
<p>To take into account both discrete energy levels of a system and the electron-electron interaction, it is convenient to start from the general Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}=\sum_{\alpha \beta} \tilde{\epsilon}_{\alpha \beta} d_{\alpha}^{\dagger} d_{\beta}+\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} V_{\alpha \beta, \gamma \delta} d_{\alpha}^{\dagger} d_{\beta}^{\dagger} d_{\gamma} d_{\delta}
\]</span> The first term of this Hamiltonian is a free-particle discrete-level model (3.94) with <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\epsilon}_{\alpha \beta}\)</span> including electrical potentials. And the second term describes all possible interactions between electrons and is equivalent to the real-space Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{e e}=\frac{1}{2} \int d \xi \int d \xi^{\prime} \hat{\psi}^{\dagger}(\xi) \hat{\psi}^{\dagger}\left(\xi^{\prime}\right) V\left(\xi, \xi^{\prime}\right) \hat{\psi}\left(\xi^{\prime}\right) \hat{\psi}(\xi)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\psi}(\xi)\)</span> are field operators <span class="math display">\[
\hat{\psi}(\xi)=\sum_{\alpha} \psi_{\alpha}(\xi) d_{\alpha}
\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{\alpha}(\xi)\)</span> are the basis single-particle functions, we remind, that spin quantum numbers are included in <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, and spin indices are included in <span class="math inline">\(\xi \equiv r, \sigma\)</span> as variables The matrix elements are defined as <span class="math display">\[
V_{\alpha \beta, \gamma \delta}=\int d \xi \int d \xi^{\prime} \psi_{\alpha}^{*}(\xi) \psi_{\beta}^{*}\left(\xi^{\prime}\right) V\left(\xi, \xi^{\prime}\right) \psi_{\gamma}(\xi) \psi_{\delta}\left(\xi^{\prime}\right)
\]</span> For pair Coulomb interaction <span class="math inline">\(V(| r |)\)</span> the matrix elements are <span class="math inline">\(V_{\alpha \beta, \gamma \delta}=\sum_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}} \int d r \int d r ^{\prime} \psi_{\alpha}^{*}( r , \sigma) \psi_{\beta}^{*}\left( r ^{\prime}, \sigma^{\prime}\right) V\left(\left| r -r^{\prime}\right|\right) \psi_{\gamma}( r , \sigma) \psi_{\delta}\left( r ^{\prime}, \sigma^{\prime}\right)\)</span> (5.11) Assume now, that the basis states <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha\rangle\)</span> are the states with definite spin quantum number <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\alpha}\)</span>. It means, that only one spin component of the wave function, namely <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{o}\left(\sigma_{\alpha}\right)\)</span> is nonzero, and <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{\alpha}\left(\bar{\sigma}_{\alpha}\right)=0 .\)</span> In this case the only nonzero matrix elements are those with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\alpha}=\sigma_{\gamma}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\beta}=\sigma_{\delta}\)</span>, they are <span class="math display">\[
V_{\alpha \beta, \gamma \delta}=\int d r \int d r ^{\prime} \psi_{\alpha}^{*}( r ) \psi_{\beta}^{*}\left( r ^{\prime}\right) V\left(\left| r -r^{\prime}\right|\right) \psi_{\gamma}( r ) \psi_{\delta}\left( r ^{\prime}\right)
\]</span> In the case of delocalized basis states <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{\alpha}( r )\)</span>, the main matrix elements are those with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta=\delta\)</span>, because the wave functions of two different states with the same spin are orthogonal in real space and their contribution is small. It is also true for the systems with localized wave functions <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{\alpha}( r )\)</span>, when the overlap between two different states is weak. In these cases it is enough to replace the interacting part by the Hubbard Hamiltonian, describing only density-density interaction <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{H}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\alpha \neq \beta} U_{\alpha \beta} \hat{n}_{\alpha} \hat{n}_{\beta}
\]</span> With the Hubbard interaction constants defined as <span class="math display">\[
U_{\alpha \beta}=\int d r \int d r ^{\prime}\left|\psi_{\alpha}( r )\right|^{2}\left|\psi_{\beta}\left( r ^{\prime}\right)\right|^{2} V\left(\left| r -r^{\prime}\right|\right)
\]</span> In the limit of a single-level quantum dot (which is, however, a two-level system because of spin degeneration) we get the Anderson impurity model (AIM) <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{A I M}=\sum_{\sigma=\uparrow \downarrow} \epsilon_{\sigma} d_{\sigma}^{\dagger} d_{\sigma}+U \hat{n}_{\uparrow} \hat{n}_{\downarrow}
\]</span> The other important limit is the constant interaction model (CIM), which is valid when many levels interact with similar energies, assuming <span class="math inline">\(U_{\alpha \beta}=U\)</span> for any states <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{A H}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\alpha \neq \beta} U_{\alpha \beta} \hat{n}_{\alpha} \hat{n}_{\beta} \approx \frac{U}{2}\left(\sum_{\alpha} \hat{n}_{\alpha}\right)^{2}-\frac{U}{2}\left(\sum_{\alpha} \hat{n}_{\alpha}^{2}\right)=\frac{U \hat{N}(\hat{N}-1)}{2}
\]</span> where we used <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}^{2}=\hat{n}\)</span>, for large <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> it is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\((5.2)\)</span> Thus, the CIM reproduces the charging energy considered above, and the Hamiltonian of an isolated system is <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{C I M}=\sum_{\alpha \beta} \tilde{\epsilon}_{\alpha \beta} d_{\alpha}^{\dagger} d_{\beta}+E(N) .
\]</span> Note, that the equilibrium compensating charge density can be easily introduced into the Hubbard Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{H}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\alpha \neq \beta} U_{\alpha \beta}\left(\hat{n}_{\alpha}-\bar{n}_{\alpha}\right)\left(\hat{n}_{\beta}-\bar{n}_{\beta}\right)
\]</span> and at <span class="math inline">\(N \gg 1\)</span> we obtain the electrostatic energy <span class="math inline">\((5.2)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(C=e^{2} / U\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="single-electron-box">5.2 Single-Electron Box</h2>
<p>The simplest nanosystem, where the effects of single charge tunneling are important, is the single-electron box (SEB), a metallic island with dense electron spectrum coupled to the lead by a weak tunneling contact with the capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C_{L}\)</span> and the resistance <span class="math inline">\(R_{L}\)</span> (Fig.5.3). Weak coupling means, that the tunneling resistance <span class="math inline">\(R_{T}\)</span> of the junction is rather high <span class="math display">\[
R_{T} \gg R_{K}=\frac{h}{e^{2}} \simeq 25.8 k \Omega
\]</span> the <span class="math inline">\(R_{K}\)</span> is a resistance quantum (it is defined only by the fundamental constants). Note, that this resistance is well known from the Landauer-Büttiker theory, where it plays the role of the minimum resistance of a single quantum channel. Thus, we understand now better the limits of weak <span class="math inline">\(\left(R_{T} \gg R_{K}\right)\)</span> and strong <span class="math inline">\(\left(R_{T} \leq R_{K}\right)\)</span> tunneling.</p>
<p>We allow also to apply some voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_{G L}\)</span> to the system through the gate capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C_{G}\)</span>. The circuit is broken in this place, and the current can not flow though a system. The gate capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C_{G}\)</span> is "true" capacitance, while the tunnel junction includes the classical capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C_{L}\)</span> and quantum "possibility to tunnel" (shown by the cross). It is not equivalent to a classical resistance, in particular, the finite voltage at the capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C_{L}\)</span> does not imply necessarily the current through the tunnel junction.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the following question: what is the charge state of the SEB at arbitrary voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_{G L}\)</span> ? The important point is, that if the condition ( <span class="math inline">\(5.19\)</span> ) is satisfied, the probability of tunneling is small, and electrons can be considered as localized inside the system almost all time. Therefore, the electronic charge of the <span class="math inline">\(SEB\)</span> is quantized and is always <span class="math inline">\(e n\)</span> with integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. However, the voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_{G L}\)</span> is arbitrary and tries to charge the capacitance by the charge <span class="math inline">\(C_{G} V_{G L}\)</span>, which is not possible in general. The solution, found by the system, is to create two charges: <span class="math inline">\(Q_{L}\)</span> at the capacitance of the tunneling contact and <span class="math inline">\(Q_{G}\)</span> at the gate capacitance, in such a way that <span class="math display">\[
Q_{L}+Q_{G}=e n
\]</span> and the voltage is also divided between capacitances as <span class="math display">\[
V_{G L}=\frac{Q_{L}}{C_{L}}-\frac{Q_{G}}{C_{G}}
\]</span> From these two equations the charges <span class="math inline">\(Q_{L}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_{G}\)</span> are easily defined as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
Q_{L} &amp;=\frac{C_{L} C_{G}}{C_{L}+C_{G}}\left(\frac{e n}{C_{G}}+V_{G L}\right) \\
Q_{G} &amp;=\frac{C_{L} C_{G}}{C_{L}+C_{G}}\left(\frac{e n}{C_{L}}-V_{G L}\right)

\]</span> Now we need the free energy of the system as a function of the electron number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with the gate voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_{G L}\)</span> as an external parameter. It allows to determine the ground state, and the probabilities of the states with different <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, which are given by the Gibbs distribution. The problem is, that when the charge <span class="math inline">\(e n\)</span> is changed, the charges <span class="math inline">\(Q_{L}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_{G}\)</span> are also changed and the external source makes the work <span class="math inline">\(-V_{G L} d Q_{G}\)</span>, note that here the asymmetry between true capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C_{G}\)</span> and the junction capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C_{L}\)</span> plays the role. After the Legendre transformation the free energy <span class="math inline">\(E^{*}(n)\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
E^{*}(n)=\frac{Q_{L}^{2}}{2 C_{L}}+\frac{Q_{G}^{2}}{2 C_{G}}+Q_{G} V_{G L}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(C=C_{L}+C_{G}\)</span>. Substituting <span class="math inline">\((5.20)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((5.21)\)</span> in this expression, we obtain <span class="math display">\[
E^{*}(n)=\frac{(e n)^{2}}{2 C}+\frac{C_{G} V_{G L}}{C}(e n)+\frac{C_{L} C_{G} V_{G L}^{2}}{2 C} .
\]</span> Neglecting the last irrelevant term independent on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we get the free electrostatic energy of a SEB with <span class="math inline">\(n=N-N_{0}\)</span> excess electrons: <span class="math display">\[
E^{*}(n)=\frac{e^{2}\left(n+Q^{*} / e\right)^{2}}{2 C}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Q^{*}=C_{G} V_{G L}\)</span> is determined by the gate voltage and is non-integer in the units of the elementary charge <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>.</p>
<p>This expression can be obtained alternatively from the simple argument, that the full energy of the system is the sum of its own electrostatic energy and the energy of the charge <span class="math inline">\(n e\)</span> in the external potential. Indeed, the first term in the formula <span class="math inline">\((5.23)\)</span> is the electrostatic energy of the isolated system, and the second term is the electrostatic energy in the external potential <span class="math inline">\(\left(C_{G} / C\right) V_{G L}\)</span> in relation to the potential of the left lead. The full potential difference (voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_{L S}\)</span> ) between the system and the left lead is (from (5.20)) <span class="math display">\[
V_{L S}=\frac{Q_{L}}{C_{L}}=\frac{e n}{C}+\frac{C_{G} V_{G L}}{C}
\]</span> where the first term is the electrical potential produced by the charge of the island with capacitance <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and the second term is produced by the external voltage. Integrating it over the charge <span class="math inline">\(n e\)</span> we obtain the free energy <span class="math inline">\((5.23)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We plot the energy <span class="math inline">\(E^{*}(n)\)</span> as a function of the gate charge <span class="math inline">\(Q^{*}\)</span> at different <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (the negative electron charge <span class="math inline">\(e=-|e|\)</span> is taken into account explicitly) in the Fig. <span class="math inline">\(5.4\)</span>. This picture shows, that the state with minimal energy is changed with <span class="math inline">\(Q^{*}\)</span>. The neutral state <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span> is stable at <span class="math inline">\(-0.5&lt;Q^{*} /|e|&lt;0.5\)</span> and so on.</p>
<p>At zero temperature (and neglecting "quantum fluctuations", e.g. treating <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as a classical variable) the number of electrons is given by the minimum of the energy (5.24). By increasing of the gate voltage, the state of the SEB is changed from <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> in the degeneracy points <span class="math inline">\(Q^{*} /|e|=n+0.5 .\)</span> Now let us consider the average number of electrons in the box <span class="math inline">\(\langle n\rangle\)</span> as a function of the gate voltage.</p>
<p>At finite temperature the probability <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> of different <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is given by the Gibbs distribution <span class="math display">\[
p(n)=\frac{1}{Z} \exp \left(-\frac{E^{*}(n)}{T}\right)
\]</span> where the normalization coefficient is determined from the condition <span class="math display">\[
\sum_{n} p(n)=1
\]</span> The average number of electrons is <span class="math display">\[
\langle n\rangle=\sum_{n} n p(n)=\frac{1}{Z} \sum_{n} n \exp \left(-\frac{E^{*}(n)}{T}\right) .
\]</span> The results of calculation at different temperatures are shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(5.5\)</span>. We see, quite obviously, that the steps are smeared with temperature and disappear almost completely at <span class="math inline">\(T \approx E_{C}\)</span>, in agreement with the estimate <span class="math inline">\((5.6)\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="single-electron-transistor">5.3 Single-Electron Transistor</h2>
<p>Now we come back to transport problems. Consider the system between two leads coupled by two weak tunneling contacts (Fig. 5.6). When there is also a third electrode (gate), the system is called single-electron transistor.</p>
<p>The electrostatic energy of the central region is given by the same formula <span class="math inline">\((5.24)\)</span> with the gate charge <span class="math inline">\(Q^{*}\)</span> determined by the combination of all voltages applied to a system and the full capacitance is <span class="math display">\[
C=C_{G}+C_{L}+C_{R}
\]</span> The addition energy to increase the number of electrons from <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
\Delta E_{n}^{+}(n \rightarrow n+1)=E^{*}(n+1)-E^{*}(n)=\frac{e^{2}}{C}\left(n+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{Q^{*}}{e}\right) .
\]</span> At zero bias voltage the system is equivalent to the single-electron box with two contacts instead of one, and the minimum energy, as well as the average number of excess electrons, are defined in the same way. At finite bias voltage <span class="math inline">\(V=V_{L}-V_{R}\)</span> the current flows through the system. To calculate this current we use the sequential tunneling approach and master equation, valid in the limit of weak system-to-lead coupling (see Sect. 4.2). To describe the transport we should calculate the nonequilibrium probability <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> of different states <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, which is not described now by the Gibbs distribution as for the single-electron box. First of all, let us determine the transition rates in the sequential tunneling regime.</p>
<h3 id="tunneling-transition-rates">5.3.1 Tunneling Transition Rates</h3>
<p>The transition rate is determined by the golden-rule expression. For example, the transition from the state <span class="math inline">\(|n\rangle\)</span> to the state <span class="math inline">\(|n+1\rangle\)</span> due to the coupling to the left lead, is determined by the full probability of tunneling of one electron from any state <span class="math inline">\(|k\rangle\)</span> in the left lead to any single-particle state <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha\rangle\)</span> : <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\Gamma_{L}^{n+1 n} &amp;=\frac{2 \pi}{\hbar}\left|\left\langle n+1\left|\hat{H}_{T L}\right| n\right\rangle\right|^{2} \delta\left(E_{i}-E_{f}\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{2 \pi}{\hbar} \sum_{k \alpha}\left|V_{k \alpha}\right|^{2} f_{k}\left(1-f_{\alpha}\right) \delta\left(E_{\alpha}+\Delta E_{n}^{+}-E_{k}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> the sum here is over all electronic states <span class="math inline">\(|k\rangle\)</span> in the left lead and all single-particle states <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha\rangle\)</span> in the system in the sense of the constant-interaction model (5.17), and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{T L}\)</span> is the part of the tunneling Hamiltonian describing coupling to the left lead. All single-particle states are assumed to be thermalized and incoherent. The Fermi distribution functions <span class="math inline">\(f_{k}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left(1-f_{\alpha}\right)\)</span> describe probability for the state <span class="math inline">\(|k\rangle\)</span> to be occupied, and for the state <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha\rangle\)</span> to be unoccupied. In such a way we take into account that the state denoted as <span class="math inline">\(|n\rangle\)</span> is, in fact, a mixed state of many single-particle states. We assume also for simplicity that the energy relaxation time is fast enough and the distribution of particles inside the system is equilibrium (but not the distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> of the different charge states!).</p>
<p>Analogously, the transition from the state <span class="math inline">\(|n\rangle\)</span> to the state <span class="math inline">\(|n-1\rangle\)</span> is determined by the probability of tunneling of one electron from the state with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> electrons to the left lead <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\Gamma_{L}^{n-1 n} &amp;=\frac{2 \pi}{\hbar}\left|\left\langle n-1\left|\hat{H}_{T L}\right| n\right\rangle\right|^{2} \delta\left(E_{i}-E_{f}\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{2 \pi}{\hbar} \sum_{k \alpha}\left|V_{k \alpha}\right|^{2} f_{\alpha}\left(1-f_{k}\right) \delta\left(E_{\alpha}+\Delta E_{n-1}^{+}-E_{k}\right)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Changing to the energy integration, we obtain <span class="math display">\[
\Gamma_{L}^{n+1 n}=\int d E_{1} \int d E_{2} \Gamma_{L}\left(E_{1}, E_{2}\right) f_{L}^{0}\left(E_{1}\right)\left(1-f_{S}^{0}\left(E_{2}\right)\right) \delta\left(E_{2}+\Delta E_{n}^{+}-E_{1}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
\Gamma_{i=L, R}\left(E_{1}, E_{2}\right)=\frac{2 \pi}{\hbar} \sum_{k \alpha}\left|V_{\alpha, i k}\right|^{2} \delta\left(E_{1}-E_{\alpha}\right) \delta\left(E_{2}-E_{k}\right)
\]</span> Further simplification is possible in the wide-band limit, assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{i=L, R}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\left(E_{1}, E_{2}\right)\)</span> is energy-independent. Finally, we arrive at <span class="math display">\[
\Gamma_{i=L, R}^{n+1 n}=\left(G_{i} / e^{2}\right) f\left(\Delta E_{n}^{+}+e V_{i S}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(G_{i}\)</span> is the tunneling conductance <span class="math display">\[
G_{i=L, R}=\frac{4 \pi e^{2}}{\hbar} N_{i}(0) N_{S}(0)|V|^{2}
\]</span> with the densities of states <span class="math inline">\(N_{i}(0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_{S}(0)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f(E)\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
f(E)=\frac{E}{\exp \left(\frac{E}{T}\right)-1}
\]</span> In the same way for the transition from <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> we get <span class="math display">\[
\Gamma_{i=L, R}^{n-1 n}=\left(G_{i} / e^{2}\right) f\left(-\Delta E_{n-1}^{+}-e V_{i S}\right)
\]</span> ### 5.3.2 Master Equation</p>
<p>Now we can write the classical master equation for the probability <span class="math inline">\(p(n, t)\)</span> to find a state with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> electrons <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d p(n, t)}{d t}=&amp;\left(\Gamma_{L}^{n n-1}+\Gamma_{R}^{n n-1}\right) p(n-1, t)+\left(\Gamma_{L}^{n n+1}+\Gamma_{R}^{n n+1}\right) p(n+1, t) \\
&amp;-\left(\Gamma_{L}^{n-1 n}+\Gamma_{L}^{n+1 n}+\Gamma_{R}^{n-1 n}+\Gamma_{R}^{n+1 n}\right) p(n, t)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where the transitions rates are calculated previously (5.35), (5.38). Introducing the short-hand notations <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\Gamma^{n n-1} &amp;=\Gamma_{L}^{n n-1}+\Gamma_{R}^{n n-1} \\
\Gamma^{n n+1} &amp;=\Gamma_{L}^{n n+1}+\Gamma_{R}^{n n+1}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> we arrive at <span class="math display">\[
\frac{d p(n, t)}{d t}=\Gamma^{n n-1} p(n-1, t)+\Gamma^{n n+1} p(n+1, t)-\left(\Gamma^{n-1 n}+\Gamma^{n+1 n}\right) p(n, t)
\]</span> The structure of this equation is completely clear. The first two terms describe transfer of one electron from the leads to the system (if the state before tunneling is <span class="math inline">\(|n-1\rangle\)</span> ) or from the system to the leads (if the initial state is <span class="math inline">\(|n+1\rangle)\)</span>, in both cases the final state is <span class="math inline">\(|n\rangle\)</span>, thus raising the probability <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> to find this state. The last term in <span class="math inline">\((5.40)\)</span> describes tunneling from the state <span class="math inline">\(|n\rangle\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(|n-1\rangle\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(|n+1\rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>The current (from the left or right lead to the system) is <span class="math display">\[
J_{i=L, R}(t)=e \sum_{n}\left(\Gamma_{i}^{n+1 n}-\Gamma_{i}^{n-1 n}\right) p(n, t)
\]</span> In the stationary case the solution of the master equation (5.40) is given by the recursive relation (which is actually the stationary balance equation between <span class="math inline">\(|n\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|n-1\rangle\)</span> states). <span class="math display">\[
\Gamma^{n-1 n} p(n)=\Gamma^{n n-1} p(n-1) .
\]</span> It can be solved very easily numerically, one can start from an arbitrary value for one of the <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span>, then calculate all other <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> going up and down in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to some fixed limiting number, and, finally, normalize all the <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> to satisfy the condition (5.27). Below we present the numerical solution in two cases: for conductance in the limit of low voltage, and for the voltage-current curves. The transport is blocked at low temperature and low voltage because of the non-zero addition energy (5.30).</p>
<h3 id="conductance-cb-oscillations">5.3.3 Conductance: CB Oscillations</h3>
<p>Consider first the conductance of a system as a function of the gate voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_{G}\)</span> (gate charge <span class="math inline">\(Q^{*}\)</span> ). The result is shown in Fig. 5.7. The conductance has a maximum in the degeneracy points <span class="math inline">\(Q^{*} /|e|=n+0.5\)</span>, when the addition energy <span class="math inline">\((5.30)\)</span> vanishes. Between these points the conductance is very small at low temperatures, because the electron can not overcome the Coulomb energy, the effect was nick-named "Coulomb blockade".</p>
<p>The phenomena can be described within the noninteracting particle picture, if we notice, that the charging energy produce, in fact, discrete energy levels, while the gate voltage works as a potential changing the position of the levels up and down in energy. The maximum of the conductance is observed when this induced discrete level is in resonance with the Fermi levels in the leads. This single-particle picture (or better to say analogy), however, should be used with care. The problem is that this single-particle level is fictional and corresponds, in fact, to a superposition of two many-particle states with different number of electrons. In the degeneracy point the probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p(n+1)\)</span> of the states with different number of electrons are equal. This circumstance shows that the Coulomb blockade is essentially manyparticle phenomena, and the mean-field (Hartree-Fock) approximation can not be used to describe it. Later we shall see, that it is a consequence of the degeneracy of a single-particle spectrum.</p>
<p>At higher temperatures, the oscillations are smeared and completely disappear at <span class="math inline">\(T \sim E_{C}\)</span>, the effect is analogous to the charge quantization in a single-electron box.</p>
<h3 id="current-voltage-curve-coulomb-staircase">5.3.4 Current-Voltage Curve: Coulomb Staircase</h3>
<p>Now let us discuss the signatures of Coulomb blockade at finite voltage. The results of calculations are presented in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(5.8\)</span> for symmetric <span class="math inline">\(\left(G_{L}=G_{R}\right)\)</span> system, and in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(5.9\)</span> for asymmetric one. First of all, the gap (called Coulomb gap) is seen clearly at low temperatures and low voltages, that is another manifestation of Coulomb blockade. In agreement with conductance calculation, this gap is closed in the degeneracy points, where the linear current-voltage relation is reproduced at low voltages. At higher temperatures the gap is smeared and linear behaviour is restored.</p>
<p>The other characteristic feature, seen at higher voltages and more pronounced in the asymmetric case, is called Coulomb staircase (Fig. 5.9) and is observed due to the participation of higher charge states in transport at higher voltage. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(V_{G}=0\)</span> the transport is blocked at low voltage and the current appears only at <span class="math inline">\(|e| V / 2&gt;E_{C}(V / 2\)</span> because the bias voltage is divided between the left and right contacts) when the Coulomb gap is overcome and the electron can go through the state <span class="math inline">\(|n=1\rangle .\)</span> At higher voltage <span class="math inline">\(|e| V / 2&gt;3 E_{C}\)</span> the state <span class="math inline">\(|n=2\rangle\)</span> becomes available, and so on. The general formula for the threshold voltages of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -th step is <span class="math display">\[
V_{n}=\pm \frac{2(2 n-1) E_{C}}{|e|}
\]</span> The amplitude of the steps is decaying with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and at large voltage the Ohmic behaviour is reproduced.</p>
<h3 id="contour-plots.-stability-diagrams">5.3.5 Contour Plots. Stability Diagrams</h3>
<p>To analyze the experiments, the contour plots of the current <span class="math inline">\(J\left(V, V_{G}\right)\)</span> (Fig.5.10) and the differential conductance <span class="math inline">\(d J / d V\left(V, V_{G}\right)\)</span> (Fig. 5.11) are very useful. The characteristic structures of Coulomb blockade (so-called Coulomb diamonds) are well pronounced in these pictures.</p>
<p>The white rhombic-shaped regions are the regions of Coulomb blockade. At zero temperature there is no current, one state with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> electrons is stable with respect to tunneling. For example, near the point <span class="math inline">\(V=V_{G}=0\)</span> the state <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span> is stable. If one changes the gate voltage, the other charge states become stable. At large enough bias voltage the stability is lost and sequential tunneling events produce a finite current. The contour plots, as well as schematic representations of the boundaries of the stability region in the <span class="math inline">\(\left(V, V_{G}\right)\)</span> plane, are often called stability diagrams.</p>
<p>While both left and right tunneling events should be suppressed, there are two stability conditions, obtained directly from the tunneling rates (5.35), (5.38) <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
|e|\left(n-\frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;C_{G} V_{G R}+C_{R} V&lt;|e|\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \\
|e|\left(n-\frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;C_{G} V_{G L}-C_{L} V&lt;|e|\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{array}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(V=V_{L}-V_{R}\)</span> is the bias voltage, and <span class="math inline">\(V_{G L}=V_{G}-V_{L}, V_{G R}=V_{G}-V_{R}\)</span> are the voltages between the gate and the leads.</p>
<p>These inequalities show that if the system leaves the stability region at finite bias voltage <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, the new state with <span class="math inline">\(n=n \pm 1\)</span>, which occurs as a result of tunneling through one junction, is also unstable with respect to tunneling through the other junction. As a result, the systems returns back to the state <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and the cycle is started again, thus the current flows through the system.</p>
<h2 id="coulomb-blockade-in-quantum-dots">5.4 Coulomb Blockade in Quantum Dots</h2>
<p>Here we want to consider the Coulomb blockade in intermediate-size quantum dots, where the typical energy level spacing <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \epsilon\)</span> is not too small to neglect it completely, but the number of levels is large enough, so that one can use the constant-interaction model (5.17), which we write in the eigenstate basis as <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{C I M}=\sum_{\alpha} \tilde{\epsilon}_{\alpha} d_{\alpha}^{\dagger} d_{\alpha}+E(n)
\]</span> where the charging energy <span class="math inline">\(E(n)\)</span> is determined in the same way as previously, for example by the expression (5.16). Note, that for quantum dots it is not convenient to incorporate the gate voltage into the free electrostatic energy (5.24), as we did before for metallic islands, also the usage of classical capacitance is not well established, although for large quantum dots it is possible. Instead, we shift the energy levels in the <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{dot} \tilde{\epsilon}_{\alpha}=\epsilon_{\alpha}+e \varphi_{\alpha}\)</span> by the electrical potential <span class="math display">\[
\varphi_{\alpha}=V_{G}+V_{R}+\eta_{\alpha}\left(V_{L}-V_{R}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\alpha}\)</span> are some coefficients, dependent on geometry. This method can be easily extended to include any self-consistent effects on the mean-field level by the help of the Poisson equation (instead of classical capacitances). Besides, if all <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\alpha}\)</span> are the same, our approach reproduces again the relevant part of the classical expressions <span class="math inline">\((5.23),(5.24)\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
\hat{E}_{C I M}=\sum_{\alpha} \epsilon_{\alpha} n_{\alpha}+E(n)+e n \varphi_{\text {ext }}
\]</span> The addition energy now depends not only on the charge of the molecule, but also on the state <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha\rangle\)</span>, in which the electron is added <span class="math display">\[
\Delta E_{n \alpha}^{+}\left(n, n_{\alpha}=0 \rightarrow n+1, n_{\alpha}=1\right)=E(n+1)-E(n)+\epsilon_{\alpha}
\]</span> We can assume in this case, that the single particle energies are additive to the charging energy, so that the full quantum eigenstate of the system is <span class="math inline">\(|n, \hat{n}\rangle\)</span>, where the set <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n} \equiv\left\{n_{\alpha}\right\}\)</span> shows whether the particular single-particle state <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha\rangle\)</span> is empty or occupied. Some arbitrary state <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}\)</span> looks like <span class="math display">\[
\hat{n} \equiv\left\{n_{\alpha}\right\} \equiv\left(n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3}, n_{4}, n_{5}, \ldots\right)=(1,1,0,1,0, \ldots)
\]</span> Note, that the distribution <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}\)</span> defines also <span class="math inline">\(n=\sum_{\alpha} n_{\alpha} .\)</span> It is convenient, however, to keep notation <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to remember about the charge state of a system, below we use both notations: <span class="math inline">\(|n, \hat{n}\rangle\)</span> and short one <span class="math inline">\(|\hat{n}\rangle\)</span> as equivalent.</p>
<p>The other important point is that the distribution function <span class="math inline">\(f_{n}(\alpha)\)</span> in the charge state <span class="math inline">\(|n\rangle\)</span> is not assumed to be in equilibrium, as previously (this condition is not specific to quantum dots with discrete energy levels, the distribution function in metallic islands can also be in nonequilibrium. However, in the parameter range, typical for classical Coulomb blockade, the tunneling time is much smaller than the energy relaxation time, and quasiparticle nonequilibrium effects are usually neglected).</p>
<p>With these new assumptions, the theory of sequential tunneling is quite the same, as was considered in the previous section. The master equation ( <span class="math inline">\(5.40\)</span> ) is replaced by <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d p(n, \hat{n}, t)}{d t}=&amp; \sum_{\hat{n}^{\prime}}\left(\Gamma_{\hat{n} \hat{n}^{\prime}}^{n n-1} p\left(n-1, \hat{n}^{\prime}, t\right)+\Gamma_{\hat{n} \hat{n}^{\prime}}^{n n+1} p\left(n+1, \hat{n}^{\prime}, t\right)\right) \\
&amp;-\sum_{\hat{n}^{\prime}}\left(\Gamma_{\hat{n}^{\prime} \hat{n}}^{n-1 n}+\Gamma_{\hat{n}^{\prime} \hat{n}}^{n+1 n}\right) p(n, \hat{n}, t)+I\{p(n, \hat{n}, t)\}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p(n, \hat{n}, t)\)</span> is now the probability to find the system in the state <span class="math inline">\(|n, \hat{n}\rangle, \Gamma_{\hat{n} \hat{n}^{\prime}}^{n n-1}\)</span> is the transition rate from the state with <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> electrons and single level occupation <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}^{\prime}\)</span> into the state with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> electrons and single level occupation <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}\)</span>. The sum is over all states <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}^{\prime}\)</span>, which are different by one electron from the state <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}\)</span>. The last term is included to describe possible inelastic processes inside the system and relaxation to the equilibrium function <span class="math inline">\(p_{e q}(n, \hat{n}) .\)</span> In principle, it is not necessary to introduce such type of dissipation in calculation, because the current is in any case finite. But the dissipation may be important in large systems and at finite temperatures. Besides, it is necessary to describe the limit of classical single-electron transport, where the distribution function of particles is assumed to be in equilibrium. Below we shall not take into account this term, assuming that tunneling is more important.</p>
<p>While all considered processes are, in fact, single-particle tunneling processes, we arrive at <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d p(\hat{n}, t)}{d t}=&amp; \sum_{\beta}\left(\delta_{n_{\beta} 1} \Gamma_{\beta}^{n n-1} p\left(\hat{n}, n_{\beta}=0, t\right)+\delta_{n_{\beta} 0} \Gamma_{\beta}^{n n+1} p\left(\hat{n}, n_{\beta}=1, t\right)\right) \\

\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(P_{e q}\left(n, n_{\alpha}=1\right)\)</span> is the joint probability that the quantum dot contains <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> electrons and the level <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is occupied <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> and the equilibrium probability (distribution function) is determined by the Gibbs distribution in the grand canonical ensemble: <span class="math display">\[
p_{e q}(\hat{n})=\frac{1}{Z} \exp \left[-\frac{1}{T}\left(\sum_{\alpha} \tilde{\epsilon}_{\alpha}+E(n)\right)\right]
\]</span> A typical behaviour of the conductance as a function of the gate voltage at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 5.12. In the resonant tunneling regime at low temperatures <span class="math inline">\(T \ll \Delta \epsilon\)</span> the peak height is strongly temperature-dependent. It is changed by classical temperature dependence (constant height) at <span class="math inline">\(T \gg \Delta \epsilon\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="transport-at-finite-bias-voltage">5.4.2 Transport at Finite Bias Voltage</h3>
<p>At finite bias voltage we find new manifestations of the interplay between singleelectron tunneling and resonant free-particle tunneling.</p>
<p>Let us consider the curve of the differential conductance (Fig. 5.13). First of all, the Coulomb staircase is reproduced, which is more pronounced than for metallic islands, because the density of states is limited by the available single-particle states and the current is saturated. Besides, small additional steps due to discrete energy levels appear. This characteristic behaviour is possible for large enough dots with <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \epsilon \ll E_{C} .\)</span> If the level spacing is of the order of the charging energy <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \epsilon \sim E_{C}\)</span>, the Coulomb blockade steps and discrete-level steps look the same, but their statistics (position and height distribution) is determined by the details of the single-particle spectrum and interactions [3].</p>
<p>Finally, let us consider the contour plot of the differential conductance (Fig. 5.14). It is essentially different from those for the metallic island (Fig. 5.11). First, it is not symmetric in the gate voltage, because the energy spectrum is restricted from the bottom, and at negative bias all the levels are above the Fermi-level (the electron charge is negative, and a negative potential means a positive energy shift). Nevertheless, existing stability patterns are of the same origin and form the same structure. The qualitatively new feature is additional lines correspondent to the additional discretelevel steps in the voltage-current curves. In general, the current and conductance of quantum dots demonstrate all typical features of discrete-level systems: current steps, and conductance peaks. Without Coulomb interaction the usual picture of resonant tunneling is reproduced. In the limit of dense energy spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \epsilon \rightarrow 0\)</span> the sharp single-level steps are merged into the smooth Coulomb staircase.</p>
<h2 id="cotunneling">5.5 Cotunneling</h2>
<p>Until now we have considered only the sequential tunneling regime, which is described by the first-order perturbation in tunneling. At low temperatures the sequential tunneling is suppressed by the Coulomb blockade (except the degeneracy points), and the conductance of the system become exponentially small. In this case the second-order processes start to be important. These processes include the events, when two electrons with different energy participate in tunneling simultaneously (so-called inelastic cotunneling), or one electron tunnels coherently twice (elastic cotunneling), which is equivalent, however, to the simultaneous tunneling of two electrons with the same energy. Note, that both terms "inelastic" and "elastic" have no relation to the presence or absence of the additional inelastic interactions inside the system.</p>
<p>The standard second-order perturbation theory yields the transition rate from some initial state <span class="math inline">\(|i\rangle\)</span> to some final state <span class="math inline">\(|f\rangle\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
\Gamma_{i \rightarrow f}^{(2)}=\frac{2 \pi}{\hbar}\left|\sum_{\lambda} \frac{\left\langle f\left|\hat{H}_{T}\right| \lambda\right\rangle\left\langle\lambda\left|\hat{H}_{T}\right| i\right\rangle}{E_{\lambda}-E_{i}}\right|^{2} \delta\left(E_{i}-E_{f}\right)
\]</span> The intermediate states <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda\rangle\)</span> are virtual states with <span class="math inline">\(E_{\lambda}&gt;E_{i} .\)</span> In this point we already assume that the system is in the Coulomb blockade regime with fixed number of electrons <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and the temperature is low <span class="math inline">\(T \ll \Delta E_{n}^{+}\)</span>, because in the opposite case thermally excited quasiparticles in the leads can overcome the energy barrier, and the sequential tunneling through high-energy states will determine the current.</p>
<p>Before considering the particular cases, let us perform all possible general calculations in (5.62). First of all, the tunneling Hamiltonian is the sum of left and right parts, we are interested only in the processes, which transfer electrons from the left to the right, and include one tunneling through the right junction and one tunneling through the left junction. Then, the initial state is a mixed state with different probabilities for the states <span class="math inline">\(|k\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|q\rangle\)</span> to be occupied or empty, following the tunneling theory we introduce the sum over all possible configurations of the initial state with corresponding occupation probabilities (distribution functions) <span class="math inline">\(f_{L}^{0}\left(E_{k}\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_{R}^{0}\left(E_{q}\right)\)</span>. Thus, we obtain <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
\Gamma_{L \rightarrow R}^{(2)}=\frac{2 \pi}{\hbar} \sum_{k \in L, q \in R} f_{L}^{0}\left(E_{k}\right)\left(1-f_{R}^{0}\left(E_{q}\right)\right) \delta\left(E_{i}-E_{f}\right) \\
\times\left|\sum_{\lambda} \frac{\left\langle f_{q}\left|\hat{H}_{T R}\right| \lambda\right\rangle\left\langle\lambda\left|\hat{H}_{T L}\right| i_{k}\right\rangle+\left\langle f_{q}\left|\hat{H}_{T L}\right| \lambda\right\rangle\left\langle\lambda\left|\hat{H}_{T R}\right| i_{k}\right\rangle}{E_{\lambda}-E_{i}}\right|^{2}
\end{array}
\]</span> The intermediate states <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda\rangle\)</span> are the states with one extra electron (or without one electron, i.e. with one extra hole) in the central system. Note, that the only thing we assume is that the charge of the central system is the same in the initial and the final states (and <span class="math inline">\(\pm e\)</span> in the virtual intermediate state). However the state and energy of the central system can change after the tunneling event. In the last case the process is called inelastic cotunneling.</p>
<p>Up to now, all our calculations are general, now it is reasonable to consider separately the contributions of inelastic and elastic cotunneling. 5.5.1 Inelastic Cotunneling Consider the final state as the state with one electron transferred from the state <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in the left lead to the state <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in the right lead with the change of the state of the system from <span class="math inline">\(\left|\lambda_{i}\right\rangle\)</span> with electron in the state <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and empty state <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\left|\lambda_{f}\right\rangle\)</span> with electron removed from <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
|f\rangle=c_{q}^{\dagger} c_{k} d_{\beta}^{\dagger} d_{\alpha}|i\rangle
\]</span> the energy conservation implies that <span class="math display">\[
E_{i}=E_{k}+E_{\alpha}=E_{f}=E_{q}+E_{\beta}
\]</span> Due to mutual incoherence of these states, not the amplitudes, but the probabilities of different events should be summarized. Below we neglect all cross-terms with different indices <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, and apply <span class="math display">\[
\left|\sum X_{\lambda}\right|^{2}=\sum\left|X_{\lambda}\right|^{2}
\]</span> In the metallic dots we can assume that the distribution over internal single-particle states is in equilibrium, and obtain <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
\Gamma_{i n}^{(2) n}=\frac{2 \pi}{\hbar} \sum_{k \in L, q \in R} \sum_{\alpha \beta}\left(\frac{1}{E_{\beta}+\Delta E_{n}^{+}-E_{k}}+\frac{1}{E_{q}-\Delta E_{n-1}^{+}-E_{\alpha}}\right)^{2}\left|V_{\alpha q}\right|^{2}\left|V_{\beta k}\right|^{2} \\
\times f_{L}^{0}\left(E_{k}\right)\left(1-f_{R}^{0}\left(E_{q}\right)\right)\left(1-f_{S}^{0}\left(E_{\beta}\right)\right) f_{S}^{0}\left(E_{\alpha}\right) \delta\left(E_{k}+E_{\alpha}-E_{q}-E_{\beta}\right)
\end{array}
\]</span> The two terms in this expression correspond to two physical processes. The first one describes the jump (virtual!) of the extra electron from the state <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in the left lead into the state <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> in the system, and then the other electron jumps through the second junction from the state <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> into the state <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in the right lead (Fig. 5.15b). In the second process (Fig. 5.15d) first the electron jumps from the system into the right lead, and then the second electron jumps from the left lead. All other matrix elements of the tunneling Hamiltonians in the expression (5.63) are zero. The distribution functions describe as usually the probabilities of necessary occupied or empty states.</p>
<p>In the wide-band limit with energy independent matrix elements we arrive at <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\Gamma_{i n}^{(2) n}=&amp; \frac{\hbar G_{L} G_{R}}{2 \pi e^{4}} \int d E_{k} \int d E_{q} \int d E_{\alpha} \int d E_{\beta} f_{L}^{0}\left(E_{k}\right)\left(1-f_{S}^{0}\left(E_{\beta}\right)\right) f_{S}^{0}\left(E_{\alpha}\right)\left(1-f_{R}^{0}\left(E_{q}\right)\right) \\

\end{aligned}
\]</span> We shall not go into further details here and refer to the original publications. Elastic cotunneling though metallic dots is usually much smaller than inelastic, because the number of states available for elastic proces is small. It can be important only at very low temperatures and voltages, because it is linear in voltage at zero temperature, while the inelastic cotunneling is nonlinear (5.71).</p>
<p>Note once more, that the expressions for cotunneling current obtained above are valid only in the Coulomb blockade regime far from the degeneracy points (where the maxima of conductance are observed), when the sequential tunneling is suppressed, voltage and temperature are not very large.</p>
