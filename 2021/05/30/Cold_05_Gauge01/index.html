<h2 id="chapter-1-introduction">Chapter 1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Abstract The topic of this thesis is at the interface between condensed matter physics and ultracold quantum gases. The introductory chapter gives a brief overview over topological quantum states of matter and important experimental works in the field of ultracold atoms that enable a study of related phenomena with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.</p>
<h2 id="topology-in-condensed-matter-physics">1.1 Topology in Condensed Matter Physics</h2>
<p>Quantum states of matter have been successfully characterized by the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking [1]. A descriptive example is the transition from a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic state of a metal. Above a critical temperature, known as the Curie temperature, the direction of the spins in the material is random and the average magnetization <span class="math inline">\(\langle M \rangle\)</span> is zero. Below a critical temperature the system enters a ferromagnetic phase, where the spins are at least partially aligned, such that the magnetization <span class="math inline">\(\langle M \rangle\)</span> takes a finite value. The ferromagnetic state is no longer invariant under spin rotation; an additional symmetry is broken compared to the paramagnetic state. The transition is characterized by the order parameter <span class="math inline">\(\langle M \rangle\)</span>, which is zero for the symmetric state and non-zero for the symmetry-breaking state.</p>
<p>With the discovery of the integer quantum Hall (QH) effect <span class="math inline">\([2,3]\)</span> a new family of quantum states was found which did not fit into this simple classification of condensed matter systems described above [4-6]. In the QH effect electrons form a QH insulator, that is insulating in the bulk but displays current-carrying states at its boundaries. Each of these states contributes one quantum of conductance <span class="math inline">\(e^{2} / h\)</span>, which gives rise to the perfectly quantized Hall conductance discovered in <span class="math inline">\(1980[2,3] .\)</span> Surprisingly, this quantization was found independent of the microscopic details of the material <span class="math inline">\([7,8] .\)</span> In fact the number of edge states is mathematically determined by the value of an integer topological invariant such that the quantization is topologically protected against small perturbations of the system.</p>
<p>In mathematics the term topology was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19 th century [9] to classify the shape of geometric objects. He started to establish a new language to describe what one could call the qualitative shape of a geometric object without making use of ordinary quantities that are usually employed to define the shape of an object. Intuitively one would say that a sphere is intrinsically different from a torus because they cannot be continuously transformed into each other. The torus belongs to a class of objects with genus <span class="math inline">\(g=1\)</span>, that are characterized by a hole independent of the specific details of its shape. In contrast a sphere belongs to a class with genus <span class="math inline">\(g=0\)</span> and does not exhibit a hole. In this sense a coffee cup is topologically equivalent to a torus and the genus is a topological invariant. It was found that mathematically these numbers can be described as integrals over the local curvature of a surface. Even though the integrands locally depend on the details of the geometry, the integral itself however does not.</p>
<p>In condensed matter systems the abstract concept of topology can be applied to determine the intrinsic properties of the corresponding energy bands. Two systems with a gapped energy spectrum can only be continuously transformed into each other if they belong to the same topological class. Otherwise the system undergoes a quantum phase transition during the transformation where the energy spectrum becomes gapless. Accordingly, smooth deformations can be defined as transformations that do not close an energy gap <span class="math inline">\([4,6] .\)</span> It turns out that observables such as the quantized conductivity in the integer QH effect, that arise due to the topological properties of the edge states, are rooted in the topological properties of the bulk <span class="math inline">\([10-12]\)</span>, which are described by the Chern number, a topological invariant defined as an integral in momentum space <span class="math inline">\([8] .\)</span></p>
<p>Since the discovery of QH insulators the field of topological materials has been rapidly growing <span class="math inline">\([4,6,13]\)</span>. Initially, it was believed that topological quantum states can only exist in <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> and if time-reversal (TR) symmetry is broken by applying a magnetic field. In 1988 Haldane [14] proposed a model Hamiltonian that supports QH states on a honeycomb lattice without external magnetic field. Such insulators are generally known as Chern insulators and even though these insulators are conceptually different from QH systems they belong to the same class. A generalization of Haldane's model was put forward by Kane and Mele [15] and Bernevig and Zhang [16], who predicted TR-symmetric topological insulators due to spin-orbit interaction. In 2D topological insulators are synonymously called quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators and were observed experimentally in HgTe/CdTe quantum well structures [17-19]. QSH materials are closely related to QH insulators; they are characterized by a charge excitation gap in the <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> bulk and gapless helical edge states that lie in the bulk gap and are protected by TR symmetry. The edge states appear in pairs at the surface and their propagation direction depends on the spin of the particle. Soon after also topological insulators in 3D were predicted [20-22] and observed in experiments <span class="math inline">\([23,24]\)</span>.</p>
<p>The origin of topological insulators can be understood in a single-particle framework. However, the physics becomes even richer if the interaction between the charge carriers plays a significant role as was first demonstrated with the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect [25, 26]. In addition to the integer QH effect new plateaus were found at fractional values of <span class="math inline">\(e^{2} / h\)</span>, which cannot be understood in a single-particle picture. FQH states are particularly interesting because they can feature fractionally-charged excitations which obey unusual statistics that are neither fermionic nor bosonic. Quantum-mechanical systems whose properties are governed by the interaction between its constituents are computationally difficult to handle. In most cases numerical results can only be obtained for small systems or in reduced dimensions. In the laboratories FQH states only exist under extreme conditions: very low temperatures and strong magnetic fields. Similar states are predicted at zero magnetic fields in fractional Chern insulators (FQI), which potentially exist even up to room temperatures [13, 27]. So far related experimental observations have not been reported, however, very recently a Chern insulator without external magnetic field has been observed experimentally [28].</p>
<h2 id="ultracold-atoms-in-optical-lattices">1.2 Ultracold Atoms in Optical Lattices</h2>
<p>A different approach to study topological physics consists in engineering synthetic materials in laboratories which exhibit the properties of interest. Synthetic materials that consist of ultracold atoms in optical lattices have proven to be very well suited to simulate and study condensed matter Hamiltonians <span class="math inline">\([29,30]\)</span>. Neutral atoms are routinely cooled and trapped in periodic potentials created by interfering laser beams [31]. Using these techniques various lattice geometries can be engineered with a high degree of experimental control [32-37]. The physics of interacting atoms in such periodic potentials can be described by the Hubbard model [38], which is an essential model Hamiltonian to describe strongly-correlated electrons in condensed matter systems. The characteristic parameters are the tunnel coupling between neighboring sites and the on-site interaction [39-41]. For bosonic atoms with repulsive interactions the system undergoes a quantum phase transition at a critical ratio of interaction to kinetic energy [42, 43], which has been observed experimentally in 2001 [44]. With ultracold atoms in optical lattices the Hubbard parameters can be tuned individually in a very clean, defect-free realization by changing the lattice depth, which changes the kinetic energy, or by controlling the interaction strength via Feshbach resonances [45].</p>
<p>Due to the high experimental controllability, cold-atom systems constitute promising candidates to gain deeper insight into the rich physics of topological materials. In particular they may provide access to physical observables typically not attainable in solid-state experiments [29]. Ultracold quantum gases are commonly probed after releasing the atoms from the trap and letting them expand for a certain amount of time (time-of-flight) to obtain information about their momentum distribution and coherence properties [29]. New generation experiments have increased the number of accessible observables to a great extent through high-resolution detection techniques [46-51]. Single-site and single-atom resolved density distributions of atoms in optical lattices have become available <span class="math inline">\([49,50]\)</span>. This new imaging techniques provide access to complex spatial correlations [52] and enabled single-site spin control of individual atoms in the lattice [53].</p>
<p>Cold-atom setups might further allow the generation of synthetic topological matter without any counterpart in nature. The most recent example is the implementation of the Haldane model [14] which was considered unlikely to be realized in condensed-matter systems but was demonstrated in a cold-atom setup [54] by breaking TR symmetry in a honeycomb lattice by applying a circular modulation [55]. Typically QH states are associated with 2D electron gases confined in a twodimensional crystalline potential and subjected to a very large magnetic field. In cold-atom setups related physical effects cannot be observed directly because the charge neutrality of the atoms prevents a direct application of the Lorentz force. To overcome this limitation several experimental techniques have been developed to engineer artificial magnetic fields which mimic the effect of real magnetic fields and many of them were already successfully demonstrated experimentally [56-59]. However, the realization of very strong synthetic magnetic fields has so far remained out of reach. It has been shown that atoms in optical lattices might be well suited to enter this regime by coupling their motional and internal degrees of freedom [60-62]. In this thesis, a similar method is discussed, where artificial gauge fields are implemented in optical lattices using laser-assisted tunneling. The underlying idea is that atoms can only tunnel between neighboring sites in the lattice due to the presence of an additional well-chosen laser configuration. This scheme has the advantage that it does not rely on the internal structure of the atom but makes use of periodic on-site modulation of the lattice using far-detuned running-wave beams [63-66]. Therefore it is less susceptible to heating due to spontaneous emission. This has lead to the successful implementation of staggered [67-69] as well as uniform flux distributions <span class="math inline">\([70-73]\)</span> in the strong-field regime and enabled the first experimental observation of a 2D topological invariant, the Chern number, in a cold-atom setup [73].</p>
<h2 id="contents-of-this-thesis">1.3 Contents of This Thesis</h2>
<p>The energy spectrum of an electron moving in a periodic potential is altered due to the presence of a magnetic field in a rather dramatic way even in a single-particle picture [74-76]. Due to the magnetic field the discrete translational symmetry of the Hamiltonian is no longer determined by the symmetry of the underlying crystal structure but by the magnetic translation symmetries which are related to the strength of the magnetic field. A theoretical discussion of the properties of the single-particle Hamiltonian of a square lattice subjected to an external magnetic field is presented in Chap. 2 .</p>
<p>In a cold-atom setting synthetic magnetic fields can be engineered using the laserassisted-tunneling technique as mentioned above. Due to the periodic on-site modulation introduced by the additional laser beams the corresponding Hamiltonian governing the dynamics is periodic in time and can be described using the Floquet theorem. This description is similar to Bloch's theorem which generally applies for spatially periodic Hamiltonians. In Chap. 3 the theoretical background of timeperiodic Hamiltonians and the generation of artificial gauge fields with laser-assisted tunneling is introduced.</p>
<p>All measurements presented in this thesis were performed with bosonic atoms. Each experimental cycle started with the preparation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of Rubidium atoms <span class="math inline">\(\left({ }^{87} Rb \right)\)</span>, which was then loaded into several optical lattice and superlattice potentials. A description of the main underlying experimental setup and measurement techniques can be found in Chap. 4 .</p>
<p>The first successful implementations of artificial gauge fields in <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> optical lattices were staggered flux distributions in triangular [67] and square lattices <span class="math inline">\([68,69]\)</span>. In these configurations the direction of the field alternates in sign across the lattice and exhibits a zero mean value. An experimental realization of such a staggered flux distribution with laser-assisted tunneling in a staggered superlattice potential is discussed in Chap. 5 .</p>
<p>In order to generate uniform flux configurations <span class="math inline">\([70,71]\)</span> the above setup was modified by replacing the staggered potential with a linear one (Chap. 6). This constitutes a realization of the Harper-Hofstadter Hamiltonian [74-76] which describes charged particles on a square lattice with uniform magnetic field; it breaks TR symmetry and gives rise to topologically non-trivial bands. Moreover, using the exact same experimental setup a Hamiltonian [77] underlying the QSH effect <span class="math inline">\([15,16]\)</span> was implemented by making use of an additional pseudo-spin degree of freedom. This further led to the observation of the spin Hall effect in an optical lattice (Chap. 6). The previously mentioned scheme, which is discussed in Chap. 6, relies on a magnetic field gradient and did not allow for an observation of the dynamics in the fully connected two-dimensional lattice but only on a local scale. The main limitation was to find an adiabatic way to connect the topologically trivial <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> lattice without flux to the topologically non-trivial one which exhibits a completely different energy spectrum. In Chap. 7 a new all-optical setup is introduced, which generates an effective uniform magnetic field without the requirement of a magnetic field gradient. This greatly increases the experimental flexibility and enabled an adiabatic loading of the atoms into the topologically non-trivial energy bands.</p>
<p>It further provided the basis for the first measurement of a <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> topological invariant in a cold-atom setup [73]. Due to the non-trivial topology of the energy bands the atoms experience a transverse motion as a response to an applied force, which is proportional to the Chern number. The experimental results are reported in Chap. <span class="math inline">\(8 .\)</span></p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-square-lattice-with-magnetic-field">Chapter 2 Square Lattice with Magnetic Field</h2>
<p>Abstract Electrons moving in a periodic potential experience a quantized energy spectrum, where the discrete energy bands are known as Bloch bands. In a magnetic field the spectrum further splits into highly degenerate Landau levels. The interplay between both effects leads to a complex fractal energy spectrum known as Hofstadter's butterfly. This chapter provides an introduction into the theoretical description of the system in the absence of interactions in terms of magnetic translation symmetries. The topological properties of the system are further discussed in terms of topological invariants, the Chern numbers, which are directly related to the quantization of the Hall conductivity.</p>
<p>Electrons moving in a periodic potential experience a quantized energy spectrum, where the discrete energy bands are known as Bloch bands. In a magnetic field the spectrum further splits into highly degenerate Landau levels. The interplay between both effects leads to a complex fractal energy spectrum known as Hofstadter's butterfly [1]. In order to observe related effects experimentally, magnetic fields on the order of one flux quantum per lattice unit cell are required. In solid state setups the lattice constants are rather small, i.e. on the order of a few angstroms. Consequently, unfeasible large magnetic fields would need to be applied to the material to enter this regime. To overcome this limitation artificial materials with larger lattice constants can be designed. Recently this was demonstrated by engineering superlattice structures with graphene placed on hexagonal boron nitride [2-4]. Additionally the same experimental regimes became accessible in photonics <span class="math inline">\([5,6]\)</span> and with ultracold atoms <span class="math inline">\([7,8]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Already the single particle physics in a periodic potential with large magnetic field shows very interesting phenomena. The motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field is accompanied by a geometric phase, the Aharonov-Bohm phase [9]. On a lattice these phases are introduced in the form of so-called Peierls phases that a particle picks up when hopping in the lattice (Sect. 2.1). Unlike the zero-field case the magnetic Hamiltonian is not invariant under the usual translation by a lattice unit vector. Instead one has to consider the magnetic translation symmetries of the Hamiltonian which effectively enlarge the usual lattice unit cell depending on the magnetic flux. The new unit cell is denoted as magnetic unit cell. Its area is determined by the strength of the flux but its dimensions are not unique (Sect. <span class="math inline">\(2.2\)</span> ). The resulting single-particle energy spectrum shows a fractal structure as a function of the magnetic flux per unit cell, which is known as Hofstadter's butterfly (Sect. 2.3). Depending on the flux the lowest tight-binding band splits into several subbands, whose topological properties are characterized by topological invariants called Chern numbers, which are directly related to the quantization of the Hall conductivity in the integer <span class="math inline">\(QH\)</span> effect (Sect. 2.4).</p>
<h2 id="peierls-phase-factors">2.1 Peierls Phase-Factors</h2>
<p>The physics of electrons moving in a periodic potential can be described by the Hubbard model, which was first introduced by John Hubbard in 1963 [10]. This model is a good approximation for systems at low temperatures where all particles occupy the lowest energy band <span class="math inline">\([11,12] .\)</span> It is typically characterized by two terms: a kinetic term that describes the hopping of particles between neighboring sites in the potential and an on-site interaction term. For a single electron in a <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> lattice potential the Hamiltonian consists only of the kinetic term and can be written in the following form <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}_{0}=-J \sum_{m, n}\left(\hat{a}_{m+1, n}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{m, n}+\hat{a}_{m, n+1}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{m, n}+ h.c. \right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{a}_{m, n}^{\dagger}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{a}_{m, n}\)</span> are the creation and annihilation operators on site <span class="math inline">\((m, n)\)</span> respectively, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the site index along <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> the one along <span class="math inline">\(y .\)</span> The model is based on the tight-binding approximation where the electrons are assumed to occupy the standard orbitals of the atoms and the overlap between atomic wave functions on neighboring sites is small. The tunneling amplitude for an electron to hop from one atom to the next is determined by the coupling matrix element <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>.</p>

\hat{H}=-J \sum_{m, n}\left( e ^{i \phi_{m, n}^{x}} \hat{a}_{m+1, n}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{m, n}+ e ^{i \phi_{m, n}^{y}} \hat{a}_{m, n+1}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{m, n}+ h.c. \right)
\]</span> The Peierls phases are a manifestation of the Aharonov-Bohm phase experienced by a charged particle moving in a magnetic field (Fig. 2.1b) <span class="math display">\[
\Phi_{A B}=-\frac{e}{\hbar} \oint_{ C } A \cdot d r =-2 \pi \Phi_{B} / \Phi_{0}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{B}\)</span> is the magnetic flux through the area enclosed by the contour <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{0}=h / e\)</span> is the magnetic flux quantum [9]. Equivalently one can define the magnetic flux per lattice unit cell in units of the magnetic flux quantum as <span class="math display">\[
\alpha=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \Phi=\frac{1}{2 \pi}\left(\phi_{m, n}^{x}+\phi_{m+1, n}^{y}-\phi_{m, n+1}^{x}-\phi_{m, n}^{y}\right)
\]</span> In the following <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> will be denoted as the flux per unit cell of the underlying lattice or simply the flux per plaquette.</p>
<h2 id="magnetic-translation-operators">2.2 Magnetic Translation Operators</h2>
<p>In the zero-field case the lattice translation operators <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}_{i}^{0}\)</span> commute with Hamiltonian (2.1) for all Bravais lattice vectors [11, 12], <span class="math display">\[
\hat{T}_{x}^{0}=\sum_{m, n} \hat{a}_{m+1, n}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{m, n}, \quad \hat{T}_{y}^{0}=\sum_{m, n} \hat{a}_{m, n+1}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{m, n}
\]</span> they further commute with each other <span class="math inline">\(\left[\hat{T}_{x}^{0}, \hat{T}_{y}^{0}\right]=0\)</span>, which allows us to apply the well-known Bloch theorem [11, 12]. In the presence of a vector potential, however, the Hamiltonian is no longer invariant under the translation by one lattice unit vector because the corresponding vector potential <span class="math inline">\(A _{m, n}\)</span> is not invariant under this discrete translation even though the magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> itself might be. Hence, the translation operators <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}_{i}^{0}\)</span> do not commute with Hamiltonian (2.2). For the following discussion it is convenient to write Hamiltonian ( <span class="math inline">\(2.2\)</span> ) in the following form <span class="math display">\[
\hat{H}=\hat{T}_{x}+\hat{T}_{y}+\text { h.c., }
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}_{x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}_{y}\)</span> describe the translation by one lattice constant along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> - and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> direction in the presence of a vector potential <span class="math inline">\(A _{m, n}\)</span> : <span class="math display">\[
\hat{T}_{x}=\sum_{m, n} \hat{a}_{m+1, n}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{m, n} e ^{i \phi_{m, n}^{x}}, \quad \hat{T}_{y}=\sum_{m, n} \hat{a}_{m, n+1}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{m, n} e ^{i \phi_{m, n}^{y}}
\]</span> For simplicity the tunnel coupling is set to <span class="math inline">\(J=-1 .\)</span> It can be easily verified that in general the operators <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}_{i}\)</span> do not commute with each other <span class="math inline">\(\left[\hat{T}_{x}, \hat{T}_{y}\right] \neq 0\)</span>, thus, they neither commute with the Hamiltonian, <span class="math inline">\(\left[\hat{T}_{x}, \hat{H}\right] \neq 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left[\hat{T}_{y}, \hat{H}\right] \neq 0\)</span>. To find the new symmetries of the lattice Hamiltonian with flux and to recover translational invariance new operators have to be constructed, which form a complete set of commuting operators with Hamiltonian (2.6). These operators are a combination of translation and gauge transformation <span class="math display">\[
\hat{T}_{x}^{M}=\sum_{m, n} \hat{a}_{m+1, n}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{m, n} e ^{i \theta_{m, n}^{x}}, \quad \hat{T}_{y}^{M}=\sum_{m, n} \hat{a}_{m, n+1}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{m, n} e ^{i \theta_{m, n}^{y}}
\]</span> and are called magnetic translations operators (MTOs) [14-16]. In general the new magnetic translation symmetry will differ from the one of the underlying lattice potential. The phases <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{m, n}^{i}\)</span> are determined by the formal requirement that the MTOs have to commute with the Hamiltonian, <span class="math inline">\(\left[\hat{T}_{i}^{M}, \hat{H}\right]=0\)</span>, leading to its index is determined by the lattice site on the lower left corner (Fig. 2.2)</p>

The vector potential <span class="math inline">\(A _{m, n}\)</span> gives rise to and effective flux per plaquette (gray shaded area) as defined in Eq. (2.10), with the convention that the magnetic field is pointing along the <span class="math inline">\(+\hat{e}_{z}\)</span> -direction. The arrows illustrate the direction of the tunneling</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Phi_{m, n}=\phi_{m, n}^{x}+\phi_{m+1, n}^{y}-\phi_{m, n+1}^{x}-\phi_{m, n}^{y}
\]</span> Although the derivation of Eq. (2.9) was carried out for general flux distributions <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{m, n}\)</span>, it might not be directly applicable in the case of more complicated configurations such as staggered flux distributions (Chap. 5). However, even in this case the corresponding MTOs can be derived using the methods described in Appendix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. The MTOs obtained in this way do commute with the Hamiltonian by construction but they do not necessarily commute with each other. The value of the commutator <span class="math inline">\(\left[\hat{T}_{x}^{M}, \hat{T}_{y}^{M}\right]\)</span> can be computed using the single-particle state <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{i, j}=\hat{a}_{i, j}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\)</span> on lattice site <span class="math inline">\((i, j)\)</span> : <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
\hat{T}_{x}^{M} \hat{T}_{y}^{M} \psi_{i, j}=\hat{T}_{x}^{M} e ^{i \theta_{i, j}^{y}} \psi_{i, j+1}= e ^{i\left(\theta_{i, j+1}^{x}+\theta_{i, j}^{y}\right)} \psi_{i+1, j+1} \\
\hat{T}_{y}^{M} \hat{T}_{x}^{M} \psi_{i, j}=\hat{T}_{y}^{M} e ^{i \theta_{i, j}^{ x }} \psi_{i+1, j}= e ^{i\left(\theta_{i, j}^{ x }+\theta_{i+1, j}^{y}\right)} \psi_{i+1, j+1}
\end{array}
\]</span> The specific form of the MTOs depends on the particular form of the vector potential <span class="math inline">\(A _{m, n}\)</span>, which in turn depends on the choice of gauge. However, there is no fundamental reason for the two magnetic translations operators <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}_{x}^{M}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{T}_{y}^{M}\)</span> defined in Eq. (2.8) to commute with each other.</p>
