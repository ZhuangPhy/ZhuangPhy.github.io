<h3 id="quantum-machine-learning">1.1 Quantum machine learning</h3>
<p>Machine learning has become an emerging discipline in the recent technologies. It can be used in a variety of fields, such as computational biology, computer vision, computer security and many others. Data analysis (DA) is an equally important part in the modern industry. The ML and DA analyze data by applying statistical methods and they provide computers learning capabilities on the basis of the analysis of observed data. On the basis of learning style, Machine learning algorithms (MAA) are basically classified into different groups, viz., supervised learning (SL), unsupervised learning (UL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL). The foremost shortcomings of using ML techniques are generally known to be computational time and storage, especially which involve bulky amounts of data. In addition to these, when the current deep learning algorithms are used, the training time can turn out to be even longer. In the subsequent generation, researchers got a viable alternative by utilizing the power of quantum computers method which can be smarter enough to reduce the storage and computational time as mentioned above.</p>
<p>Many ML problems use linear algebra to figure out matrix operations by expressing the data in matrices. Quantum computing (QC) is able to make several linear algebra computations more fast, which unreservedly improve classical ML tasks [1, 2]. Numerical methods for optimization are well admired field of research, which intend to improve the computations of the said optimization procedures. Like classical optimization, quantum optimization, a branch of QC, attempts to improve the said techniques even further. Two renowned methods of this kind are Quantum Gradient Descent (QGD) [3] and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) [4]. These methods are efficiently applied in quantum neural networks (QNN) like Quantum Boltzman Machines [5].</p>
<p>Of late, the quantum machine learning, a very new field of emerging interdisciplinary research area, has come out, with the objective of coalescing the theory of machine learning with the properties of quantum computing. Quantum machine learning (QML) is intended for implementing machine learning algorithms (MLLs) in quantum atmosphere (systems) [6], by applying quantum features such as quantum superposition and quantum entanglement for solving different problems with high efficacy. Basically, QML is known to be a sub-discipline of quantum research of information processing, with the objective of introducing quantum algorithms that generally learn from data with the aim of improving existing approaches in ML. Hence, the purpose is to develop quantum applications of various MLLs, having the influence of quantum computers as well as the flexibility and learning ability of MLLs.</p>
<p>Several quantum algorithms have been introduced for a variety of machine learning models which include neural networks (NN), graphical models, support vector machines (SVM) so on and so forth. QML explores more basic questions about the thought of learning from the quantum perspective. In some occasions, the QML is extensively defined by researchers to apply ML to quantum information. Besides the implicit methodologies used in QML, there exists few quantum versions of classical ML algorithms. Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) [1], which is basically applied for linear classification, is a popular example of this type. In addition to that, Quantum Principle Component Analysis (QPCA) [7], a popular approach for dimensionality reduction, Quantum Guassian Mixture Models [8], another renowned approach for estimating clustering and density. An emerging sub-discipline of ML is called Deep Learning (DL). These days, quantum computers are employed for DL applications, which involve significant storage and time. Some popular examples of these applications are Quantum Boltzmann Machines [5], Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks [9], Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks [10] and Quantum Variational Autoencoders [11]. Additionally, a more enlightened field inside ML is known as Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL can be described as learning as time continues by exploring the environment.</p>
<h3 id="grover-search-algorithm">1.2 Grover search algorithm</h3>
<p>Grover's Search Algorithm (GAA) is a very popular quantum search algorithm [12]. This algorithm finds a group of elements which satisfy a certain condition. For performing this task, a black box, usually known as an oracle, having the capability of identifying the elements, must satisfy the criteria that are required to find. Let us suppose that the group has <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> elements, the oracle is called <span class="math inline">\(O(M)\)</span> times for classical computations to get all elements that satisfy the above-mentioned criteria. Using quantum mechanics, this algorithm is able to attain the same result by using <span class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{M})\)</span> calls to the oracle.</p>
<p>The algorithm has the capability to make several calls to the oracle simultaneously by exploiting a special feature of quantum computing, called parallel processing. Let us assume that a search list has <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> number of elements. GAA uses a Hilbert space of dimension <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to represent them, which can be achieved with <span class="math inline">\(n=\log M\)</span> (base 2) qubits. Each <span class="math inline">\(e l \in N\)</span> with index <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is denoted by an orthonormal vector, called <span class="math inline">\(|y\rangle\)</span> in the qubits's state space. The objective is to identify the index <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> of that particular element satisfying the given search criteria.</p>
<p>At the outset, the oracle is being employed, in which a unitary operation having features given by 1. if <span class="math inline">\(\quad y=z, U_{z}|y\rangle=-|y\rangle\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\begin{array}{ll}\text { 2. } &amp; \text { if } \quad y \neq z, U_{z}|y\rangle=|y\rangle\end{array}\)</span> The eqs. (1.1a) and (1.1b) can also be expressed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
U_{z}=I-2|z\rangle\langle z|
\]</span></p>
<p>where, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> denotes the identity operator. The GAA simultaneously uses the last oracle operator and the Grover diffusion operators, as defined by <span class="math display">\[
U_{p}=2|p\rangle\langle p|-I
\]</span> where, <span class="math inline">\(|p\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{y=1}^{N} y\)</span>. The eq. (1.2) and (1.3) are utilized as follows. At initial, the qubits' state is being initialized to the <span class="math inline">\(|p\rangle\)</span> state. Thereafter, <span class="math inline">\(U_{z}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_{p}\)</span> are successively applied iteratively for <span class="math inline">\(r(N)\)</span> number of times. Afterwards, the system is assessed, which provides the eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(\left(\lambda_{z}\right)\)</span>, which may conclude the said index <span class="math inline">\((z)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-reinforcement-learning">1.3 Quantum reinforcement learning</h3>
<p>Besides supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning (RL) is also a popular category of learning method. In contrast to SL and UL, RL employs a scalar value called reward to assess the input-output pairs and uses the policy of trialand error to interact with the environment for learning a mapping from states to actions. Since the year of 1980 , RL has gradually become a significant approach to ML [5]. So far, it has been extensively applied in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in robotics <span class="math inline">\([13-17] .\)</span> It is due to the fact that it shows an excellent performance in on-line adaptation, and in addition, it has a prevailing learning ability to any complex nonlinear systems.</p>
<p>There may have some complicated problems while dealing with practical applications, such as the exploration strategy, slow learning speed; in particular handling complex problems. It can be observed, especially whilst the state-action space grows to be gigantic and the number of parameters that are to be learned grows up exponentially with the increase of dimension. So far, several methods have been introduced in the recent years to combat this situation.</p>
<p>Different learning paradigms are united for optimizing RL. Smith [18] proposed a novel model to represent and generalize in model-less RL on the basis of self-organizing map (SOM) and benchmark Q-learning. In addition, for the sake of adaptation of fuzzy inference systems with Watkins' Q-learning for problems having large/continuous state-action spaces is also presented [17,19,20]. Different RL methods have been improved in practice <span class="math inline">\([21-24] .\)</span></p>
<p>Two significant quantum algorithms, called the Shor algorithm [25,26] and the Grover algorithm <span class="math inline">\([27,28],\)</span> have been introduced. Rigatos and Tzafestas [29] applied the theory of quantum computing to get the benefit of parallelization of fuzzy-logic control algorithm (FCA), whose objective is to speed up the fuzzy inference. Quantuminspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEA) have been developed to enhance the performance of the existing evolutionary algorithms (EA) [30]. Later, Hogg and Portnov [31] introduced a quantum algorithm to solve combinatorial optimization problem having over constrained satisfiability and asymmetric traveling salesman. In recent times, the quantum search method has been applied to dynamic programming [32]. Taking into account the spirit of computation, Dong et al. [33] have developed the concept of Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) inspired by the basic concept of quantum computing, called state superposition principle and parallelism. QRL was developed to speed-up learning and attaining a trade-off between exploitation and exploration of RL in the course of simulated experiments.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-annealing">1.4 Quantum annealing</h3>
<p>In statistical mechanics, quantum annealing (QA) that is applied in the field of quantum-mechanical fluctuations is the quantum version of the simulated annealing (SA) [34, 35]. It is also known as Quantum Stochastic Optimization algorithm. Like the SA, quantum annealing is also successfully applied to solve the hard optimization problem. It works on the principal of the quantum adiabatic evolution in the active field of the quantum computation and it is a profitable hybridization between classical and quantum technology. QA is applied in different fields as computer science [36], machine learning [37, 38], graph theory [39], communications [40-42], finance [43], aeronautics [44] and any others real world problems.</p>
<p>In simulated annealing [45], a temperature dependent random walk of a statistical-mechanical system is employed as the cost function of a given optimization problem. This function determines the potential energy profile of the solution space and thermal fluctuations avoid that the exploration gets stuck in a local minimum [46]. It is expected that the system will stay close to thermal equilibrium during time evolution. It can happen if the rate of decrease of temperature is sufficiently slow, and thus lead in the end to the zero-temperature equilibrium state, the lowest-energy state [47]. Due to the general applicability, reasonable performance, and relatively easy implementation in most cases, SA is employed effectively in many real life applications. When a problem requires an infinitely long time to derive the exact solution by keeping the system close to thermal equilibrium, SA is applied to obtain the approximate solution within a measurable computation time. The quantum fluctuations are induced in QA by introducing artificial degrees of quantum nature, noncommutative operators. The strength of the quantum fluctuations are controlled to reach the ground state by slowly reducing the temperature.</p>
<p>Like the finding the minimization of a cost function of a optimization problem, it can be considered as finding the ground state of a classical Ising Hamiltonian H0 [48]. Different types of practical problems have cost functions with large number of local minima. Similarly, Ising Hamiltonians are remindful of classical spin glasses [49, 50]. For these types of characteristics, it is very tough to find the global minima for classical algorithms. This problem can be overcame with the idea to elevate the classical Ising Hamiltonian Ho to the quantum domain. Based on the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics, the ground state of the classical Ising model can be derived by formatting the system in the ground state of some initial Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(H 1[51,52] .\)</span> It is easy to develop both theoretically and experimentally. H1 is selected in such a way it does not exchange with Ho. The Hamiltonian changes gradually from <span class="math inline">\(H 1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(H 0\)</span> as the system parameters modified sufficiently slowly.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-neural-networks">1.5 Quantum neural networks</h3>
<p>Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are incarnations of neural network models entailing the principles of quantum mechanics. From the computational point of view <span class="math inline">\([53,54],\)</span> one class of quantum neural network combine artificial neural network models and embed the features of quantum computing inside to evolve more robust and efficient models. The basic philosophy behind these efforts is to circumvent the limitations of classical neural networks in handling big data by resorting to the features of quantum parallelism, interference and entanglement. However, most of the QNN models try to replace the classical binary or the McCulloch-Pitts neurons with qubits (also called "qurons") manifested with quantum mechanical principles.</p>
<p>In 1995, Subhash Kak [55] and Ron Chrisley [56] put forward the idea of a quantum neural model by establishing the similarity of the neural activation function with the quantum mechanical Eigenvalue equation. Ajit Narayanan and Tammy Menneer introduced a photonic implementation of a quantum neural network using the many-universe theory which collapses into the desired states on application of quantum measurement [57]. Since then, a lot of efforts have been invested to find the quantum version of the perceptron. However, the advances in this direction was impeded due to the fact that the characteristic neural nonlinear activation functions seldom follow the mathematical structure of quantum theory due to the inherent linear operations in a quantum system. After much effort, Schuld, Sinayskiy and Petruccione used the quantum phase estimation algorithm [58] to implement the activation function. Apart from this, lots of quantum-inspired models have come up to implement a fuzzy logic based neural network [59].</p>
<p>Elizabeth Behrman and Jim Steck [60] proposed a novel quantum computing setup comprising a number of qubits with tunable mutual interactions. In their model, the interaction strengths are updated using a training set of desired inputoutput relations following the classical back-propagation algorithm thereby enabling the quantum network to learn an algorithm.</p>
