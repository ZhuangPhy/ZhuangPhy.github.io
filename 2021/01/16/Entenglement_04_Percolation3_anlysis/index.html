<h2 id="摘要">摘要</h2>
<p>研究了一系列的可解模型，解析得到相变点。</p>
<p>We identify a phase transition between two kinds of volume-law entangled phases in non-local but few-body unitary dynamics with local projective measurements.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In one phase, a finite fraction of the system belongs to a fully-entangled state, one for which no subsystem is in a pure state</li>
<li>while in the second phase, the steady-state is a product state over extensively many, finite subsystems.</li>
</ol>
<p>We study this "separability" transition in a family of <strong>solvable models</strong> in which we <strong>analytically determine</strong> the transition point, the evolution of certain entanglement properties of interest, and relate this to a mean-field percolation transition.</p>
<p>定义了这个相变的序参量“entangling power” 。研究序参量在张量网络和Clifford动力学下的行为之后，我们认为，在我们的模型中，可分离性的转变与经典确定稳态的输出概率分布的计算 "难度 "的转变相吻合。</p>
<p>Since the entanglement entropy density does not distinguish these phases, we introduce the entangling power - which measures whether local measurements outside of two finite subsystems can boost their mutual information - as an order parameter, after considering its behavior in tensor network states, and numerically studying its behavior in a model of Clifford dynamics with measurements. We argue that in our models, the separability transition coincides with a transition in the computational "hardness" of classically determining the output probability distribution for the steady-state in a certain basis of product states. A prediction for this distribution, which is accurate in the separable phase, and should deviate from the true distribution in the fully-entangled phase, provides a possible benchmarking task for quantum computers.</p>
<h2 id="近况背景">近况背景</h2>
<p>New phases of entangled, out-of- equilibrium quantum matter have been an exciting topic of recent study. A sufficiently generic, isolated quantum system is expected to approach local, thermal equilibrium under its own unitary dynamics, develop an extensive amount of entanglement entropy <span class="math inline">\([1-3],\)</span> and lose local memory of its initial state. Random, local, unitary quantum circuits have provided a useful theoretical toolbox to study this <strong>delocalization of information</strong> and development of "volume-law" entanglement on the approach to equilibrium <span class="math inline">\([4-15]\)</span> 随机幺正线路成为工具箱，来研究信息退局域化和趋向平衡态过程的体积律。</p>
<p>Recent studies have revealed that in the presence of both unitary dynamics and local, projective measurements, there is a phase transition between a steady-state with volume-law or area-law scaling of the von Neumann entanglement entropy as the measurement rate is increased <span class="math inline">\([16-27] .\)</span> This volume-law state, however, appears <strong>qualitatively different</strong>质地不同 than thermal quantum matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>In one spatial dimension, this volume-law state is characterized by a universal, logarithmic correction to the entanglement entropy <span class="math inline">\([18,28],\)</span></li>
<li>and the stability of this phase in the presence of measurements has been related to the theory of quantum <strong>error-correcting codes</strong> [21,22,28] .</li>

<p>局域热化，可以通过一系列的局部操作来区分。在这项工作中，我们通过识别两个volume-law纠缠相之间的相位转换来确定这样的一个区别，这两个相位出现在经历非局域但少体、单元进化和局部投影测量的状态的动态中。The local thermalization of a quantum system, however, can potentially be consistent with different kinds of multi-partite patterns of entanglement in the state, that can nevertheless be distinguished by a series of local operations. In this work, we identify one such distinction by identifying a phase transition between two volumelaw entangled phases that emerge in the dynamics of a state undergoing non-local, but few-body, unitary evolution and local projective measurements.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In one phase, a finite fraction of the system belongs to a fully-entangled state, one for which the entanglement entropy is non-zero for any bipartitioning;</li>
<li>in the other phase, the full state of the system is given by a product state over extensively many, finite subsystems.</li>
</ol>
<p>A caricature of this separable phase is a random configuration of <strong>Bell pairs</strong>, for which the typical entanglement entropy density of a subsystem is non-zero, even though the system is globally in a relatively simple product state.</p>

<p>We present a family of solvable models of these dynamics in which both this phase transition, and certain entanglement properties of the evolving state can be studied exactly. The solvability of our models stems from the fact that these few-body unitary dynamics with projective measurements can be re-cast as a measurement-outcome dependent unitary transformation on the initial state; a graphical description of this unitary transition leads to a precise connection between this phase transition and mean-field percolation. This is reminiscent of connections between two-dimensional classical percolation, and the measurement-driven entanglement transition in one spatial dimension <span class="math inline">\([16,19,20],\)</span> though the techniques used here differ substantially, as the unitary gates in our models constitute "instantaneous quantum polynomial-time" (IQP) dynamics [29] which are not in the Clifford group, and for which we do not invoke a "minimal-cut" prescription to compute the entanglement properties of interest. Our techniques also allow us to show that the fully-entangled phase attained in the presence of measurements differs substantially from a random volumelaw-entangled (Page) state <span class="math inline">\([30],\)</span> as the steady-state in an <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> -site system only requires <span class="math inline">\(O(N)\)</span> few-body but non-local unitary gates to be prepared from a product state.</p>
<p>Since the entanglement entropy density alone does not distinguish between the fully-entangled and separable phases, we identify a new order parameter for this phase transition, termed the entangling power of the state, which is defined as the change in the quantum mutual information between two finite subsystems after performing projective measurements in the remainder of the system. Qualitatively, the entangling power probes the extent to which measurements can leverage the entanglement in the steady-state to communicate information between subsystems. We argue that this is an order parameter for the transition by considering its behavior in a random tensor-network state, and through numerical simulations of Clifford dynamics with measurements, from which we extract critical exponents for the behavior of this quantity near the transition point.</p>
<p>We conclude by identifying a transition in the classical hardness of determining the probability distribution of the steady-state over a particular basis of product states that coincides with the separability transition in our toy model. This "computational phase transition" is related to the fact that sampling the distribution of measurement outcomes in a certain basis for a state produced by a sufficiently random IQP unitary circuit requires calculating a "partition function" for an Ising model with complex weights, for which there is no known classically efficient algorithm [29]. Nevertheless, we argue that the structure of the wavefunction in the separable phase permits a classically efficient way to perform this task, and that this breaks down in the fully-entangled phase. The transition in the hardness of this sampling task provides an intriguing test for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ) [31], which have already demonstrated the ability to generate fully-entangled qubit states <span class="math inline">\([32,33],\)</span> and can sample the outputs of random quantum circuits [34].</p>
<p>几个有趣的开放性问题</p>
<p>A number of interesting questions remain to be studied about these dynamics, which we leave for future work.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, it would be interesting to determine if the transition between fully-entangled and separable phases can occur within the volume-law entangled phase of spatially local unitary dynamics with projective measurements; this may generically be possible, and complementary to the already observed measurement-driven entanglement transition. 这种相变是否会发生在 空间局部幺正动力学的体积律纠缠相内。</li>
<li>Second, the universality class of this phase transition may differ from infinite-dimensional percolation in a more generic setting, where the wavefunction does not admit a graphical description. 这种相变的普遍性类别可能不同于更一般环境下的无限维渗流。因为无限维渗流的波函数不允许用图示来描述。</li>
<li>In addition, it would be interesting to see if the classical difficulty in simulating the quantum dynamics of these two volumelaw entangled phases is more universally distinct, outside of the concrete proposal for our models, and if the fully-entangled phase could potentially provide a useful source of quantum error-correcting codes with low-weight "parity-check" operations; we leave this for future study. 如果完全纠缠相可以潜在地提供一个有用的量子纠错代码的低重量 "奇偶校验 "操作的来源，那就很有趣的去看看在模拟困难是否是更普遍。</li>
</ol>
<p>During completion of this work, we became aware of a new version of Ref. [22], which includes a brief discussion of a similar transition in non-local unitary dynamics with projective measurements, by invoking a minimal-cut prescription for the calculation of the entanglement.</p>

<p>系统的初始化，演化规则</p>
<p>Unitary Dynamics with Measurements: We consider the evolution of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> spins that are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>initialized</strong> in a product state in the Pauli- <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> basis.</li>
<li>At each <strong>timestep</strong>, we apply a two-site unitary gate - which are diagonal in the Pauli- <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> basis - between a randomly chosen pair of spins. While these unitary operations mutually commute, they <strong>generate</strong> a high degree of entanglement when acting on states in a generic basis.</li>
<li>After applying these gates, we <strong>measure</strong> a randomly-chosen spin in the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> basis; this spin is then rotated back into the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> basis to the state <span class="math inline">\(|\rightarrow\rangle,\)</span> so that it can continue to entangle with other spins.</li>
</ol>
<p>A single "timestep" of our dynamics consists of applying</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{u}\)</span> two-site unitary operations<br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{m}\)</span> measurements.</li>
</ul>
<p>波函数As shown in the Supplemental Material, the evolving wavefunction for these dynamics <span class="math display">\[
\Psi(s ; t) \equiv\left\langle s_{1}, \ldots, s_{N} \mid \Psi(t)\right\rangle
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(s_{j} \equiv\left(1-Z_{j}\right) / 2\)</span> (so that <span class="math inline">\(s_{j}=0\)</span> or 1 if the spin <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> points up or down, respectively) always takes the form <span class="math display">\[
\Psi( s ; t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \exp \left[\frac{i}{2} s ^{T} \theta (t) s +i w (t) \cdot s \right]
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\theta (t)\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(N \times N\)</span> symmetric matrix,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(w (t)\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> -component vector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these quantities are defined modulo <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi .\)</span> Additionally, <span class="math inline">\(D=2^{N}\)</span> is the Hilbert space dimension of the system. In other words, the dynamics with measurements that we have described can be re-cast as a measurement-outcome-dependent unitary transformation on the initial state, which we can readily compute. Furthermore, these dynamics encompass two distinct types of evolution.这个动力学可以重构为初始状态上的一个测量-结果相关的单元变换，我们可以很容易地计算出来。</p>

C Z_{12}\left|s_{1} s_{2}\right\rangle=(-1)^{s_{1} s_{2}}\left|s_{1} s_{2}\right\rangle,

In this case, <span class="math inline">\(\theta (t)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\pi G (t),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(G (t)\)</span> is a binary matrix with entries zero or one. For a bi-partitioning of the system into subsystems <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and its complement <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A},\)</span> the von Neumann entanglement entropy is known [36] to be <span class="math display">\[
S_{A}(t)=\operatorname{Tr}\left[\rho_{A}(t) \log _{2} \rho_{A}(t)\right]=\operatorname{rank}_{ F _{2}}\left[G_{A \bar{A}}(t)\right],
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(G_{A \bar{A}}\)</span> the off-diagonal part of the matrix <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, which connects sites in the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> subsystems. This matrix also appears in the natural choice of Pauli operators ("stabilizers") that fix the evolving state of the spins as <span class="math inline">\(O _{n}(t)|\Psi(t)\rangle=|\Psi(t)\rangle\)</span> (for <span class="math inline">\(n=1, \ldots, N)\)</span>; these operators are given up to an overall sign as <span class="math display">\[
O _{n}(t) \sim X_{n} \prod_{m=1}^{N}\left(Z_{m}\right)^{G_{n m}(t)} 
\]</span> Clifford states of this form have been studied in the context of measurement-based quantum computation <span class="math inline">\([37],\)</span> and it is known that any stabilizer state can be brought into a state of this form through the action of local Clifford operations [38,39]</p>

<p>Non-Clifford Dynamics: Unitary dynamics consisting of more generic, mutually-commuting two-qubit gates which generate no entanglement in the Pauli- <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> basis are often referred to as "instantaneous quantum polynomialtime" (IQP) dynamics, and the output distribution of measurements in a generic basis from a state generated by a random IQP circuit classically intractable [29,40] . We will return to the tractability of sampling from an IQP circuit in the final section of this work.</p>
<p>对于这两种动力学，我们希望确定一个给定的子系统何时与系统的其余部分解纠缠disentangled</p>
<p>For both of these kinds of dynamics, we would like to determine when a given subsystem is disentangled from the remainder of the system.</p>
<p>解纠缠的条件</p>
<p>As we show in the Supplemental Material, a subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is <strong>disentangled</strong> from its complement <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{A \bar{A}}\)</span> the off-diagonal part of <span class="math inline">\(\theta (t)\)</span> that connects nodes in sub-systems <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}-\)</span> is the zero matrix.</p>

</ul>
<p>Equivalently, we may restrict our attention to an <span class="math inline">\(N \times N\)</span> <strong>binary matrix</strong> <span class="math inline">\(G (t),\)</span> defined so that each entry is one if the corresponding entry in <span class="math inline">\(\theta (t)\)</span> is non-zero, and is zero otherwise. This matrix is naturally thought of as an adjacency matrix for an undirected graph on <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> nodes, one for each spin in the system. If the two-site unitary gates consist of exclusively control- <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> gates, then this graph describes the evolution of the stabilizers that define this state, as discussed previously. The dynamics of this graph, however, are the same for any choice of commuting unitary gates, and are given by the following dynamical rules</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When a measurement is performed in the <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> basis on spin <span class="math inline">\(k,\)</span> and the spin is then rotated into the Pauli <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> basis, the graph evolves by removing all of the bonds from node <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</li>
<li>When a two-site unitary gate is applied, the corresponding nodes in the graph are connected by bond.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first rule is exact, while the second rule becomes exact in the thermodynamic limit. For the latter rule to be valid for a given pair of spins, either one has to have undergone a measurement more recently than that exact pair has been acted upon by a unitary gate, which is exactly true in the thermodynamic <span class="math inline">\((N \rightarrow \infty)\)</span> limit.</p>
<h2 id="separability-相变">Separability 相变</h2>
<p>The steadystate entanglement properties of the wavefunction change dramatically as the measurement rate is tuned.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the measurement rate is sufficiently small, a finite fraction of the spins will be fully entangled, and will belong to a single <strong>non-separable state</strong>, one for which the von Neumann entanglement entropy is non-zero for any bipartitioning.</li>
<li>As the measurement rate is increased, however, there will eventually be a sharp phase transition, beyond which the wavefunction will resemble a product state over small clusters of spins. This separability phase transition is summarized in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span></li>

<p>这个结果的直觉来自于状态的可分离性的演化的图形规则The intuition for this result comes from the graphical rules for the evolution of the separability of state, which involves the growth and fragmentation of a graph due to the unitary gates and measurements. We will analytically access this transition and study its properties in the following section.</p>

<li>稳定子的规范基础中，权重<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>在时间<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>的稳定子的数量密度。</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the rules for the evolution of the graph <span class="math inline">\(G (t),\)</span> we now study the evolution of the separability of the wavefunction. Let <span class="math inline">\(s_{k}(t)\)</span> be the number density of sites in the graph that have degree <span class="math inline">\((k-1) .\)</span> We emphasize that if the unitary gates are chosen to be control- <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> gates and the dynamics are in the Clifford group, then <span class="math inline">\(s_{k}(t)\)</span> is precisely the number density of stabilizers of weight <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in this canonical basis of stabilizers described previously.</p>
<p>速率方程</p>
<p>Since the total number of nodes in the graph is conserved <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{k \geq 1} s_{k}(t)=1\)</span> at any point in the dynamics. In a time-continuum limit, the number density of nodes in the graph of a certain degree satisfies a rate equation <span class="math display">\[
\frac{d s_{k}}{d t}=\sum_{j} s_{j} \gamma_{j \rightarrow k}-s_{k} \sum_{j} \gamma_{k \rightarrow j}
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{j \rightarrow k}\)</span> is the rate at which nodes of size <span class="math inline">\(j-1\)</span> transform into nodes of degree <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> under the dynamics.</li>

<li>节点的度数因 two-site unitary operations 而增长。</li>

</ul>
<p>This rate equation manifestly conserves the total number of nodes as required. From the dynamical rules for the graphical evolution of the state of the system, we observe that</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the degree of a node grows due the twosite unitary operations.</li>
<li>Furthermore, a measurement removes all bonds from the corresponding node in the graphical representation of the state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Putting these two elements of the dynamics together yields the expression <span class="math display">\[
\gamma_{j \rightarrow k}=2 \Gamma_{u} \delta_{j, k-1}+\Gamma_{m}\left[k \delta_{j, k+1}+\delta_{k, 1}\left(1-\delta_{j, 1}\right)\right] .
\]</span> The last term in this expression arises since every measurement creates a node with zero degree.</p>
<p>给出稳态解合理的两点理由。补充材料里推导出精确解，在极限下可以退化为稳态解。</p>
<p>The linearity of the rate equation permits an exact solution to Eq. in order to obtain the full, timedependent dynamics of the graph, as shown in the Supplemental Material. In the steady-state, we find that <span class="math display">\[
s_{k}^{(\infty)}=g\left[1-\frac{\Gamma(k, 1 / g)}{\Gamma(k)}\right]
\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(a, b)\)</span> is the incomplete gamma function</li>
<li>the dimensionless parameter <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is defined as <span class="math inline">\(g \equiv \Gamma_{m} /\left(2 \Gamma_{u}\right)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Eq. (3) is significant for a few reasons.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, the average degree of a node is finite, and approaches <span class="math inline">\(1 / 2 g\)</span> in the steady-state. Therefore, in the presence of these projective measurements, the number of unitary operations needed to prepare the steady-state from the initial state only scales as <span class="math inline">\(O\left(g^{-1} N\right)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Second, for Clifford dynamics, Eq. (3) is precisely the distribution of stabilizer sizes in the canonical basis. As an illustration of the accuracy of this result, we observe that for Clifford dynamics, the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a single spin - denoted <span class="math inline">\(S_{\text {spin }}(t)-\)</span> is precisely the fraction of stabilizers which are of length greater than one, so that <span class="math inline">\(S_{\text {spin }}(t)=1-s_{1}(t)\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the exact solution to Eq. (2) derived in the Supplemental Material, this yields <span class="math display">\[
S_{ spin }(t)=1-g+g e^{-\left(1-e^{-\Gamma_{m} t}\right) / g}\left(1-\frac{e^{-\Gamma_{m} t}}{g}\right)
\]</span> so that in the steady-state, the average entanglement of a spin is <span class="math display">\[
\lim _{\Gamma_{m} t \rightarrow \infty} S_{ spin }(t)=1-g\left(1-e^{-1 / g}\right)
\]</span> The equilibrium value of the average, single-spin entanglement entropy is plotted in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2,\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>越大，测量m的比例越大，所以纠缠熵就越小。合理</p>

<h4 id="自旋属于团簇的概率">自旋属于团簇的概率</h4>
<p>First, the graph corresponding to the steady-state wavefunction contains a connected cluster of nodes encompassing a finite fraction of the system, and the corresponding wavefunction is fully entangled, under the following conditions.</p>

<li>The probability that a random node in the graph will have degree- <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(Q_{k}=s_{k+1}^{(\infty)},\)</span></li>
<li>while the probability distribution for the degree of a node's reached by following a random bond is <span class="math inline">\(P_{k}=2 g k s_{k+1}^{(\infty)}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Therefore, the number of nodes that can be reached by starting at a random node and following the bonds of the graph for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> steps [55] is <span class="math inline">\(\left(\sum_{k}(k-1) P_{k}\right)^{m} .\)</span></li>

<p>Other properties of the wavefunction near criticality may be determined by exploiting known results on meanfield percolation. For the percolation transition, the number density of finite clusters of size <span class="math inline">\(k,\)</span> denoted <span class="math inline">\(n_{k}\)</span> is known to behave near the critical point as [43] <span class="math display">\[

<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(s(g) \sim\left|g-g_{c}\right|^{-1 / \sigma}\)</span> is the size of the largest finite cluster.</li>
<li>The universal exponents <span class="math inline">\(\sigma, \tau\)</span> are given by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(1 / 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau=5 / 2\)</span> for mean-field percolation [43].</li>

\]</span> where the sum is over the finite-sized clusters in the graph [56] describe the fraction of spins that belong to the largest fully-entangled state, and the fluctuations in the cluster distribution, respectively. A consequence of Eq. (7) is that in a finite-sized system, these quantities near criticality, with both <span class="math inline">\(f_{m}(z)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_{\chi}(z),\)</span> analytic functions of their arguments.</p>
<p>We verify the power-law decay of the number of fullyentangled clusters in Eq. <span class="math inline">\((7),\)</span> along with the scaling of the fluctuations in the size of these clusters in Eq. (10) in numerical simulations of Clifford dynamics. The distribution of cluster sizes, shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(4,\)</span> is obtained by simulating <span class="math inline">\(10^{5}\)</span> realizations of the dynamics for each value of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in a system of <span class="math inline">\(N=2000\)</span> spins. The numerical results show the power-law decay of the cluster distribution as criticality is approached, which is consistent with the expected <span class="math inline">\(n_{k} \sim k^{-5 / 2}\)</span> behavior. The scaling collapse in Fig. 5 is obtained similarly, by averaging the fluctuations in the cluster size over <span class="math inline">\(10^{5}\)</span> realizations of the dynamics for each indicated system size. This collapse is consistent with the scaling form in Eq. (8).</p>
<h2 id="序参量">序参量</h2>
<p>An Order Parameter for the Transition: We now introduce a measurable order parameter that distinguishes between the fully-entangled and separable phases, and study its behavior near criticality. To motivate our proposal, we observe that the mutual information between finite subsystems is small in both phases. In the fully-entangled phase, this is because the density matrix for every finite region will be close to the identity (infinite temperature), while in the separable phase, the low mutual information is due to the fact that a typical group of spins will belong to a separable product state, and will not be entangled "with each other"; a caricature of the steady-state in the separable phase is given by a random configuration of Bell pairs, for which the mutual information between a typical pair of spins is strictly zero. To distinguish between these two forms of volume-law entanglement, we propose an order parameter - termed the entangling power of the state - and study its behavior near criticality. In the steady-state, we tri-partition our system into disjoint sub-systems <span class="math inline">\((A, B, C),\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> each consisting of a finite number of spins. We now consider the change in the von Neumann mutual information between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> after performing singlequbit measurements in the <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> subsystem in an arbitrary basis. We define the order parameter as this change in the mutual information, averaged over realizations of the dynamics, which we denote as <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\Delta I_{A B}}\)</span>. The entangling power probes the extent to which measurements alone can increase the mutual information between qubits, by leveraging the existing entanglement in the steady-state.</p>
<p>The entangling power behaves as a natural order parameter for this transition. First, consider a state <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> for which two finite subsystems <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are disentangled from each other; that is, the full state of the system can be written as <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle=\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle \otimes\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle\)</span> where the subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> belongs to state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle,\)</span> while <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> belongs to <span class="math inline">\(\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle\)</span> Single-qubit measurements outside of the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> subsystems cannot change the mutual information between these subsystems, since they belong to a separable state, so the entangling power <span class="math inline">\(\Delta I_{A B}=0 .\)</span> More generally in the separable phase, the entangling power, which decays at least as fast as the probability that two randomly chosen spins belong to an entangled cluster in the separable phase, will vanish as <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\Delta I_{A B}} \lesssim 1 / N,\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(N \rightarrow \infty\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the fully-entangled phase, however, we may argue that the entangling power is generally be non-zero by considering specific examples. First, we consider the behavior of the entangling power in a random tensornetwork state for <span class="math inline">\(N \gg 1\)</span> spins. For such a state, the mutual information between two finite subsystems <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will typically be small <span class="math inline">\(I_{A B} \approx 0 .\)</span> We now consider an arbitrary subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A^{\prime}\)</span> which include the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> subsystem <span class="math inline">\(\left(A \subseteq A^{\prime}\right)\)</span> and is disjoint with <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> as illustrated in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(6 .\)</span> Subject to these conditions, we choose <span class="math inline">\(A^{\prime}\)</span> such that its von Neumann entanglement entropy is minimized and is given by <span class="math inline">\(S_{A^{\prime}}=\log d\)</span>. The von Neumann entanglement entropy may be obtained by considering a "minimal cut" through the bonds of the tensor network state when <span class="math inline">\(d_{A}, d_{B}, d \gg 1,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d_{A, B}\)</span> are the Hilbert space dimensions of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B[57]\)</span>; this is an upper bound to the entanglement which is saturated when the bond dimensions of the tensor network are sufficiently large. This implies that the state may be written as the product of two tensors with bond dimension <span class="math inline">\(d,|\Psi\rangle=\sum_{s=1}^{d} V_{s}^{\sigma_{A^{\prime}}} W_{s}^{ \mu _{\bar{A}^{\prime}}}\left| \sigma _{A^{\prime}}, \mu _{\bar{A}^{\prime}}\right\rangle\)</span> as shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(6 .\)</span> We now perform projective measurements of all of the degrees of freedom outside of the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> subsystems. From the minimal cut prescription and the particular choice of the <span class="math inline">\(A^{\prime}\)</span> subsystem, the mutual information after performing these measurements is <span class="math inline">\(2 \log d\)</span>. Equivalently, the change in the mutual information <span class="math display">\[
\Delta I_{A B}=2 S_{A^{\prime}}=2 \log d
\]</span> Therefore, the entangling power reveals the bottleneck in the entanglement between the two subsystems, i.e. the minimal extent to which these subsystems are truly entangled "with each other". We note that the minimal cut prescription in this example is independent of the measurement basis, and the measurement outcomes. Apart from random tensor networks, we have checked that other fully-entangled states also exhibit this behavior. In code states of the 5 -qubit code [50] for example, any pair of spins has zero mutual information. Taking <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to be two random spins, we have checked that performing measurements of the remaining spins in a random basis generically boosts their mutual information.</p>
<p>Critical Behavior of the Order Parameter: We now study the behavior of the entangling power in the Clifford dynamics discussed previously. We choose the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> subsystems to each be a randomly chosen spin. We measure the entangling power by computing the change in the mutual information between these two spins after measuring the remaining spins in the Pauli <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> basis, and averaging over <span class="math inline">\(O\left(10^{5}\right)\)</span> iterations. The behavior of the order parameter as a function of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is shown in Fig. 7 a for <span class="math inline">\(N=200\)</span> spins.</p>
<p>We further propose the finite-size scaling form for the entangling power near criticality <span class="math display">\[
\overline{\Delta I_{A B}}(g, N)=N^{-\beta / \nu} h\left(N^{1 / \nu}\left|g-g_{c}\right|\right)
\]</span> From fitting the value of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\Delta I_{A B}}\)</span> at criticality <span class="math inline">\(\left(g=g_{c}\right)\)</span> as a function of system size, we find that <span class="math inline">\(\beta / \nu=0.881 \pm 0.039\)</span> as shown in the inset in Fig. 7 b. A finite-size scaling collapse for <span class="math inline">\(1 / \nu=0.18\)</span> is also shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(7 b\)</span> for various system sizes.</p>
<h3 id="计算硬度">计算硬度</h3>
<p>Computational "Hardness" of the Entangled and Separable Phases: In one spatial dimension, the measurement-driven transition between asymptotically volume- or area-law scaling of the entanglement entropy naturally corresponds to a transition in the computational difficulty in simulating these dynamics; the resources required to store the wavefunction of a manybody system scale with the entanglement of a bipartitioning, making simulation of the dynamics of a generic, volume-law entangled state unfeasible in a large system <span class="math inline">\([16,27] .\)</span> Moreover, sampling the output probability distribution of a many-body wavefunction in a fixed basis is classically unfeasible at sufficiently long times if the state is evolving under random unitary gates [51]. For allto-all dynamics involving projective measurements, and generic (e.g. Haar-random) few-body unitary gates, we are not aware of a classically-efficient way to simulate the dynamics as the rate of projective measurements is increased, even if the system undergoes a separability transition. Nevertheless, for the IQP dynamics we have described, in which the applied unitary gates are random, non-Clifford unitary gates that mutually commute, there is a sampling task whose difficulty coincides with the separability phase transition.</p>
<p>While the wavefunction (1) for a state generated by an IQP circuit is clearly classically efficient to track and store, determining the probability distribution for this state over product states in the Pauli <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> basis can still be classically hard [29]. In the separable phase, this task is substantially simplified by the fact that <span class="math inline">\((i)\)</span> this distribution is given by the product of the distributions for each of the finite, separable components of the state and (ii) the structure of the wavefunction permits an efficient calculation of this distribution for each separable component. An estimate of the "hardness" of this calculation is as follows: the size of the largest fully-entangled cluster in the separable phase of the system is <span class="math inline">\(O(s(g) \log N)\)</span> due to the exponential decay of the cluster size distribution in Eq. <span class="math inline">\((7),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s(g) \sim\left|g-g_{c}\right|^{-2}\)</span> near criticality in a thermodynamically large system [58].</p>

<p>A naive assumption for the difficulty of calculating the probability for each separable component, would be that it would take a time exponentially long in the size of each component. This estimate is substantially improved by observing that in the separable phase, a unitary operator will typically be applied between two spins that belong to clusters that are disentangled from each other. As a result, the graph <span class="math inline">\(G (t)\)</span> corresponding to the separable phase will consist of trees, i.e. graphs for which there are no loops, and for which there is a unique path connecting any two nodes, so that the total number of paths connecting all pairs of points scales quadratically in the size of the tree. Probabilities such as <span class="math inline">\(|\langle\rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow \mid \Psi(t)\rangle|^{2}=\left|\sum_{s} \Psi(s ; t)\right|^{2}\)</span> require calculat- ing sums over paths on the graph <span class="math inline">\(G(t)\)</span> with complex weights. With this, the typical size of a large entangled cluster in the separable phase, and assuming that there are <span class="math inline">\(O(N / s(g) \log N)\)</span> such clusters, we obtain the estimate that only <span class="math inline">\(O(s(g) N \log N)\)</span> operations would be required to calculate the probability distribution for the steadystate in the Pauli- <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> basis. In a finite system, the critical point is broadened into a scaling window <span class="math inline">\(\left|g-g_{c}\right| \sim N^{-1 / 3}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\([45,46] .\)</span> This implies that <span class="math inline">\(s(g)\)</span> diverges as <span class="math inline">\(s(g) \sim N^{2 / 3}\)</span> near criticality, and leads to an esetimate <span class="math inline">\(O\left(N^{5 / 3} \log N\right)\)</span> operations required to determine the probability of being in a particular state in the Pauli- <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> basis. In contrast, in the fully-entangled phase, the largest fully-entangled cluster of spins covers a finite fraction of the system, and determining these probabilities require calculating the "partition function" for an Ising model with complex weights on a random graph with <span class="math inline">\(O(N)\)</span> nodes. Since the degree of each node in the graph is finite, the graph will locally appear to be tree-like. Nevertheless, the graph corresponding to this cluster will consist of long loops of length <span class="math inline">\(\ell \gg \log N .\)</span> We are unaware of an efficient way that this can be performed <span class="math inline">\([29,40] .\)</span></p>
<p>We conclude by making these ideas more precise through a concrete experiment. In the steady-state, we apply a single-qubit unitary operation <span class="math inline">\(U(t)\)</span> which restores an Ising symmetry to the state, so that <span class="math inline">\(|\Phi(t)\rangle \equiv\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(U(t)|\Psi(t)\rangle\)</span> satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle\Phi(t)\left|\prod_{m} X_{m}\right| \Phi(t)\right\rangle=1\)</span> at all times. <span class="math inline">\(\quad\)</span> Concretely, <span class="math inline">\(U(t) \equiv \sum_{s} \exp [-i s \cdot z(t)]|s\rangle\langle s|\)</span> where the vector <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> has components <span class="math inline">\(z_{m}(t) \equiv w_{m}(t)+\)</span> <span class="math inline">\((1 / 2) \sum_{n} \theta_{m n}(t) .\)</span> We claim that the probability <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{n}=\pm 1\)</span> denotes the state of spin <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> in the Pauli <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> basis, the return probability <span class="math inline">\(P(t)\)</span> on a tree graph is exactly <span class="math display">\[
P(t)=\prod_{n&lt;m} \cos ^{2}\left[\theta_{n m}(t) / 4\right]
\]</span> This quantity should agree with the true return probability, deep in the separable phase, and deviate from this in the fully-entangled phase, which could provide an additional signature of this transition.</p>
