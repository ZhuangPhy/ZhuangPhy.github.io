In such a regime, the properties of the statistical systems can be efficiently described by a quantum field theory. Right at the critical point, the correlation length is infinite: the corresponding field theory is therefore massless and becomes invariant under a dilation of the length-scales <span class="math display">\[x_{a} \rightarrow \lambda x_{a}\]</span> Under this transformation the fields <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{i}\)</span> associated to the order parameters transform as <span class="math display">\[\Phi_{i} \rightarrow \lambda^{d_{i}} \Phi_{i}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d_{i}\)</span> here denote their anomalous dimensions. Finding the spectrum of the anomalous dimensions is a central problem of the theory: in fact, from Chapter 8 we know that they determine the critical exponents of the various thermodynamic quantities. The singularities of these thermodynamic functions are associated to the fixed points of the renormalization group. In turn, in the vicinity of the fixed points there is a surface of instability that is spanned by the relevant operators present at the fixed points. In order to determine all fixed points and the spectrum of the operators nearby, A. Polyakov has put forward the hypothesis that the critical fluctuations are invariant under the set of conformal transformations. These transformations have the distinguished property of stretching locally the lengths of the vectors but leaving their relative angles invariant. It is important to stress that in systems with local interactions that are invariant under translations and rotations, the invariance under a global dilatation automatically implies an invariance under the conformal transformations. From this point of view, the classification of the fixed points of the renormalization group is equivalent to finding all possible quantum field theories with conformal symmetry. It is worth emphasizing that the construction of such theories is based on an approach that is completely different from the lagrangian formalism that is usually used in quantum field theory and that was discussed in Chapter 7 . The approach that we present in this chapter is based on the algebra of local fields. We assume first of all the existence of a basis of local operators that include among others the order parameters. Secondly, we make the hypothesis that any other quantity, such as products of order parameters, can be expanded in terms of the local operators of the basis. In this way, one is naturally led to introduce the concept of the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) and its corresponding algebra.</p><p>In this chapter we study the general properties of these conformal invariant theories, pointing out the peculiar aspects that arise in two dimensions. The next chapter will be devoted to the analysis of an important class of two-dimensional conformal field theories, the so-called minimal models: their remarkable property is to have an operatorial algebra that closes within a finite number of conformal families. Other aspects of two-dimensional conformal theories will be the subject of subsequent chapters.</p><h3 id="the-algebra-of-local-fields">2 The Algebra of Local Fields</h3><p>The main goal of a quantum field theory is the determination of the correlation functions <span class="math display">\[G\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)=\left\langle A_{1}\left(x_{1}\right) A_{2}\left(x_{2}\right) \ldots A_{n}\left(x_{n}\right)\right\rangle\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A_{i}\left(x_{i}\right)\)</span> are regular local functions that, for simplicity, we will assume are constructed in terms of only one fundamental field <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(x) .\)</span> Below we consider the euclidean formulation of the theory and our definition of the vacuum expectation values is provided by the functional integral, with Boltzmann weight given by the action <span class="math inline">\(S[\varphi]\)</span> of the field <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> <span class="math display">\[G\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right) \equiv \frac{1}{Z} \int D \varphi A_{1}\left(x_{1}\right) \ldots A_{n}\left(x_{n}\right) e^{-S[\varphi]}\]</span> The correct normalization is ensured by the partition function <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> <span class="math display">\[Z=\int D \varphi e^{-S[\varphi]}\]</span> In order to clarify the important concept of the algebra of the local field, it is useful to initially consider the free bosonic field <span class="math inline">\(\phi(x)\)</span>. In this case, using <span class="math inline">\(\phi(x)\)</span> and the normal ordered product of its powers, <span class="math inline">\({ }^{1}\)</span> we can define the local scalar densities <span class="math display">\[\phi(x),: \phi^{2}(x):,: \phi^{3}(x):, \ldots: \phi^{n}(x):\]</span> In a euclidean <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> -dimensional space-time, the scalar field <span class="math inline">\(\phi(x)\)</span> has dimension equal to <span class="math inline">\(d_{\varphi}=(D-2) / 2\)</span> (in mass units) and the dimensions of the composite fields <span class="math inline">\((10.2 .2)\)</span> are given by <span class="math inline">\(^{2}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[d_{\phi}, 2 d_{\phi}, 3 d_{\phi}, \ldots, n d_{\phi}\]</span> as is easily seen by applying Wick's theorem. For instance <span class="math display">\[\left\langle: \phi^{2}(x):: \phi^{2}(y):\right\rangle=2[\langle\phi(x) \phi(y)\rangle]^{2}\]</span> and the singularity <span class="math inline">\(1 / r^{2 d_{\phi}}\)</span> of the correlator <span class="math inline">\(\langle\phi(x) \phi(y)\rangle\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(r=\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right| \rightarrow 0\)</span>, gives rise to <span class="math display">\[\left\langle: \phi^{2}(x):: \phi^{2}(y):\right\rangle \sim \frac{1}{r^{4 d_{\phi}}}\]</span> An analogous result holds for the composite operators : <span class="math inline">\(\phi^{n}(x):\)</span>, so that we arrive at the sequence of dimensions <span class="math inline">\((10.2 .3) .\)</span></p><p>The set of fields <span class="math inline">\(\left\{: \phi^{n}(x):\right\},\)</span> to which we have to add the identity operator <span class="math inline">\(I \equiv \phi^{0}\)</span> can be used to express any other regular density <span class="math inline">\(A(x)\)</span> of the free bosonic field. This is done by the series expansion of <span class="math inline">\(A(x)\)</span> <span class="math display">\[A(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}: \phi^{n}(x):\]</span> Basis of local operators. As in the free case, we make the hypothesis that there is a similar set of fields also in the interacting theories. Namely, we assume the existence of a numerable set of fields <span class="math inline">\(^{3} \varphi_{i}(x)\)</span>, that are eigenvectors of the dilation operator, whose dimensions are defined by the condition <span class="math display">\[\varphi_{i}(x)=\lambda^{d_{i}} \varphi_{i}(\lambda x)\]</span> Moreover, we assume that any other operator can be expressed as a linear combination of the fields above: <span class="math display">\[A(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} \varphi_{n}(x)\]</span> Basis of local operators. As in the free case, we make the hypothesis that there is a similar set of fields also in the interacting theories. Namely, we assume the existence of a numerable set of fields <span class="math inline">\(^{3} \varphi_{i}(x),\)</span> that are eigenvectors of the dilation operator, whose dimensions are defined by the condition <span class="math display">\[\varphi_{i}(x)=\lambda^{d_{i}} \varphi_{i}(\lambda x)\]</span> Moreover, we assume that any other operator can be expressed as a linear combination of the fields above: <span class="math display">\[A(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} \varphi_{n}(x)\]</span> At the critical point, the propagator of these operators is <span class="math display">\[D _{i j}\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\right) \equiv\left\langle\varphi_{i}\left(x_{1}\right) \varphi_{j}\left(x_{2}\right)\right\rangle=\frac{ A _{i j}}{\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right|^{d_{i}+d_{j}}}\]</span> where the numerical constant <span class="math inline">\(A _{i j}\)</span> expresses their normalization. In an interactive theory, however, the dimensions <span class="math inline">\(d_{i}\)</span> are not expressed in a simple way as in the free theory. As a matter of fact, one of the fundamental problems is the determination of their values.</p><p>It is worth saying that the validity of the operatorial identity <span class="math inline">\((10.2 .6),\)</span> as well as other identities of similar nature that we will meet later on, has to be understood in a weak sense: this means that it can be used straighforwardly in expressions that involve correlation functions but it can give rise to inconsistencies if interpreted strictly as an operatorial identity (see Problem 1). So, for instance, to calculate the correlation function <span class="math inline">\(\langle A(x) B(y) \ldots C(z)\rangle,\)</span> we can use the expansion <span class="math inline">\((10.2 .6)\)</span> to express any of these fields - say <span class="math inline">\(A(x)\)</span> - arriving in this way at the expression <span class="math display">\[\langle A(x) B(y) \ldots C(z)\rangle=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}\left\langle\varphi_{n}(x) B(y) \ldots C(z)\right\rangle\]</span> In the vicinity of the critical point, the theory has a mass scale <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> that is a small quantity (it is related to the correlation length <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> by the relation <span class="math inline">\(\xi=m^{-1}\)</span> ), and the vacuum expectation values of the fields <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{n}\)</span> can be expressed as <span class="math display">\[\left\langle\varphi_{n}(x)\right\rangle=\mu_{n} m^{d_{n}}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{n}\)</span> are dimensionless quantities. At the critical point <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow 0\)</span> and all fields <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{n}(x)\)</span> <span class="math inline">\((n=1,2, \ldots),\)</span> but the identity operator, have zero expectation value <span class="math display">\[\left\langle\varphi_{n}(x)\right\rangle=0, \quad n=1,2, \ldots\]</span> Operator algebra. So far we have discussed the operatorial expressions that refer to a given point. Consider now the product of two fluctuating fields <span class="math inline">\(A\left(x_{1}\right) B\left(x_{2}\right)\)</span> placed at two distinct points. If their separation is much less than the correlation length <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> of the system, in particular if we consider the limit <span class="math inline">\(x_{1} \rightarrow x_{2}\)</span>, it is a natural hypothesis that the properties of this composite operator become those of a local operator, so that it can be expanded in the same basis <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{n}\)</span> given above: <span class="math display">\[A\left(x_{1}\right) B\left(x_{2}\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \beta\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right) \varphi_{k}\left(x_{2}\right)\]</span> where the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\beta\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)\)</span> contain the dependence on the coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_{2}\)</span>. If we specialize this relation to the case in which both <span class="math inline">\(A\left(x_{1}\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\left(x_{2}\right)\)</span> are themselves members of the basis, we arrive at the operator algebra <span class="math display">\[\varphi_{p}\left(x_{1}\right) \varphi_{q}\left(x_{2}\right)=\sum_{r=0}^{\infty} C_{p q}^{r}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right) \varphi_{r}\left(x_{2}\right)\]</span> The function <span class="math inline">\(C_{p q}^{r}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)\)</span> can be further constrained. If the system is invariant under translations, it can only depend on the separation <span class="math inline">\(\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right|\)</span> of the two points. At the critical point, the system is also invariant under the scale transformation <span class="math inline">\(x \rightarrow \lambda x\)</span> and, for the transformation law of the fields <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{n},\)</span> it is easy to see that <span class="math inline">\(C_{p q}^{r}\left(\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right|\right)\)</span> is a homogeneous function of degree <span class="math inline">\(d_{r}-d_{p}-d_{q} .\)</span> Hence, it can be written as <span class="math display">\[C_{p q}^{r}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=c_{p q}^{r} \frac{1}{\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right|^{d_{p}+d_{q}-d_{r}}}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c_{p q}^{r}\)</span> are pure numbers, known as the structure constants of the operator algebra.</p><p>To summarize, the hypothesis of an algebra of the local fields consists of: (i) the existence of a basis made of scaling operators <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{i}(x)\)</span> with dimensions <span class="math inline">\(d_{i}\)</span>; (ii) the validity of the operatorial algebra <span class="math display">\[\varphi_{p}\left(x_{1}\right) \varphi_{q}\left(x_{2}\right)=\sum_{r=0}^{\infty} c_{p q}^{r} \frac{1}{\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right|^{d_{p}+d_{q}-d_{r}}} \varphi_{r}\left(x_{2}\right)\]</span> which holds at the critical point of the theory. The solution of the field theories that describe the fixed points of the renormalization group consists of finding the spectrum of the dimensions <span class="math inline">\(d_{i}\)</span> of the scaling fields, together with the set of structure constants <span class="math inline">\(c_{p q}^{r}:\)</span> once all these quantities are known, one can compute in principle any other correlation functions (see Problem 2).</p><p>Some consequences. Note that there are some immediate consequences of the operator algebra: first of all, to be consistent, the algebra <span class="math inline">\((10.2 .13)\)</span> has to be associative. Consider the four-point correlation functions of the fields <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{i}(x)\)</span> shown in Fig. 10.1 : <span class="math display">\[G_{i j k l}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}\right)=\left\langle\varphi_{i}\left(x_{1}\right) \varphi_{j}\left(x_{2}\right) \varphi_{k}\left(x_{3}\right) \varphi_{l}\left(x_{4}\right)\right\rangle\]</span> As shown in Fig. 10.2 , using the operator algebra this correlator can be computed in two equivalent ways:</p><ul><li>expanding the product <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{i}\left(x_{1}\right) \varphi_{i}\left(x_{2}\right)\)</span> and then contracting the resulting field <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{m}\left(x_{2}\right)\)</span> with the field <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{n}\left(x_{4}\right)\)</span> that comes from an analogous expansion of the product <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{k}\left(x_{3}\right) \varphi_{l}\left(x_{4}\right)\)</span> (with a sum over the intermediate indices <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> );</li><li>alternatively, expanding the two pairs <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{i}\left(x_{1}\right) \varphi_{k}\left(x_{3}\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{j}\left(x_{2}\right) \varphi_{l}\left(x_{4}\right),\)</span> with a final sum over the indices of the propagators of the resulting fields.</li></ul><p>The equivalence of these two procedures is known as the duality symmetry of the four-point correlation function. It corresponds to the associativity condition of the operatorial algebra and consists of the infinite number of constraints <span class="math display">\[\sum_{m, n} C_{i j}^{m}\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\right) D _{m, n}\left(x_{2}-x_{4}\right) C_{k l}^{n}\left(x_{3}-x_{4}\right)=\sum_{m, n} C_{i k}^{m}\left(x_{1}-x_{3}\right) D _{m, n}\left(x_{3}-x_{4}\right) C_{j l}^{n}\left(x_{2}-x_{4}\right)\]</span> <img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210108140656433.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><blockquote><p>Four-point correlation functions of the scaling fields.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210108140731875.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><blockquote><p>Fig. 10.2 Duality of the four-point correlation function that corresponds to the associativity condition of the algebra (10.2.13).</p></blockquote><p>Using the expressions <span class="math inline">\((10.2 .7)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((10.2 .12),\)</span> this set of equations can be in principle enforced to determine all the scaling dimensions <span class="math inline">\(d_{i}\)</span> and the structure constants <span class="math inline">\(c_{p q}^{r}\)</span> of the algebra. For this reason they are known as conformal bootstrap equations: <span class="math inline">\(^{5}\)</span> if we were able to solve them, the dynamical data would be determined self-consistently from the theory itself. They were proposed originally by A. Polyakov as an alternative approach to solve the quantum field theories of the critical points. Unfortunately their direct solution proved to be extremely difficult and not much progress has been achieved by their analysis. An important step forward can instead be obtained by studying the important consequences of an additional symmetry of the fixed points, namely the conformal symmetry.</p><h3 id="conformal-invariance">3 Conformal Invariance</h3><p>At the critical point, a statistical system is invariant under a global dilatation of the length-scale, <span class="math inline">\(x \rightarrow \lambda x\)</span>. Consider now two subsystems, separated by a distance <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> considerably larger than their linear dimension <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> : in this case, it is obvious that the fluctuations will be more uncorrelated when the ratio <span class="math inline">\(L / l\)</span> becomes large as in Fig. 10.3 . However, near the critical point, there does not exist any length-scale and the ratio above can be made arbitrarily large. In this way we arrive at the conclusion that the two subsystems are statistically independent, i.e. that the system is not only invariant under a global dilatation but also under the local scale transformations <span class="math display">\[x \rightarrow \lambda(x) x\]</span> also called conformal transformations. The previous considerations can be formulated as a theorem, developed originally by A.

The translation invariance implies the conservation law <span class="math display">\[\partial_{\mu} T^{\mu \nu}(x)=0\]</span> obtained by integrating eqn (10.3.14) by parts and using the invariance of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> under an arbitrary variation of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(a^{\mu}\)</span> in the expression <span class="math inline">\((10.3 .7)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. The rotational invariance implies that the stress-energy tensor is symmetric with respect to its indices <span class="math display">\[T^{\mu \nu}(x)=T^{\nu \mu}(x)\]</span> as can be seen by substituting in eqn (10.3.14) the transformation (10.3.8). The invariance under dilatation, given by the transformation <span class="math inline">\((10.3 .9),\)</span> finally leads to a zero trace condition <span class="math display">\[T_{\mu}^{\mu}(x)=0\]</span> In view of eqns <span class="math inline">\((10.3 .15),(10.3 .16),\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((10.3 .17),\)</span> the action is automatically invariant under the conformal transformations that satisfy eqn <span class="math inline">\((10.3 .5)\)</span>.</p><h3 id="quasi-primary-fields">4 Quasi-Primary Fields</h3><p>The conformal invariance of a statistical system at a critical point permits us to prove a series of important results on the correlation functions of a special class of its operators. These operators are called quasi-primary and in this section they will be denoted as <span class="math inline">\(Q_{n}(x) .\)</span> They have the property of transforming under a generic conformal mapping as <span class="math display">\[Q_{n}(x)=\left|\frac{\partial x^{\prime}}{\partial x}\right|^{d_{n} / D} Q_{n}\left(x^{\prime}\right)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\left|\frac{\partial x^{\prime}}{\partial x}\right|\)</span> is the Jacobian of the mapping. For the transformations associated to the translations and rotations we have <span class="math display">\[\left|\frac{\partial x^{\prime}}{\partial x}\right|=1\]</span> while for the dilatation and the special conformal transformations we have, respectively, <span class="math display">\[\left|\frac{\partial x^{\prime}}{\partial x}\right|=\lambda^{D}, \quad\left|\frac{\partial x^{\prime}}{\partial x}\right|=\frac{1}{\left(1+2 b \cdot x+b^{2} x^{2}\right)^{D}}\]</span> The transformation law <span class="math inline">\((10.4 .1)\)</span> of the primary fields is obviously more specific than the simple scaling law <span class="math inline">\((10.2 .5)\)</span> and therefore it imposes more restrictive conditions on the correlation functions of these fields. They satisfy the equation <span class="math display">\[\left\langle Q_{1}\left(x_{1}\right) Q_{2}\left(x_{2}\right) \ldots Q_{n}\left(x_{n}\right)\right\rangle=\left|\frac{\partial x^{\prime}}{\partial x}\right|_{x=x_{1}}^{d_{1} / D} \cdots\left|\frac{\partial x^{\prime}}{\partial x}\right|_{x=x_{n}}^{d_{1} / D}\left\langle Q_{1}\left(x_{1}^{\prime}\right) Q_{2}\left(x_{2}^{\prime}\right) \ldots Q_{n}\left(x_{n}^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle\]</span> Let us consider the two-point correlation functions <span class="math display">\[G_{a b}^{(2)}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)=\left\langle Q_{a}\left(x_{1}\right) Q_{b}\left(x_{2}\right)\right\rangle\]</span> Due to the translation and rotational invariance, it depends on the relative distance <span class="math inline">\(\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right| .\)</span> The dilatation invariance implies that <span class="math inline">\(G_{a b}^{(2)}\)</span> behaves as <span class="math inline">\(\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right|^{-d_{a}-d_{b}}\)</span> Finally, using the invariance under the special conformal transformation (10.3.11), we arrive at the condition <span class="math display">\[\delta G_{a b}^{(2)}=-\left[d_{a}\left(b \cdot x_{1}\right)+d_{b}\left(b \cdot x_{2}\right)\right] G_{a b}^{(2)}\]</span> This implies that <span class="math inline">\(G_{a b}^{(2)}\left(\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right|\right)\)</span> is different from zero only when <span class="math inline">\(d_{a}=d_{b} .\)</span> Hence, the two-point correlation functions of the quasi-primary fields satisfy an orthogonality condition. By an appropriate normalization of these fields, their general expression is then <span class="math display">\[\left\langle Q_{a}\left(x_{1}\right) Q_{b}\left(x_{2}\right)\right\rangle=\frac{\delta_{a b}}{\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\right|^{2 d_{a}}}\]</span> Consider now the three-point correlation functions of the quasi-primary fields <span class="math display">\[G_{a b c}^{(3)}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\right)=\left\langle Q_{a}\left(x_{1}\right) Q_{b}\left(x_{2}\right) Q_{c}\left(x_{3}\right)\right\rangle\]</span> As usual, the invariance under translations and rotations implies that this correlator depends on the relative distances <span class="math inline">\(x_{i j} \equiv\left|x_{i}-x_{j}\right|(i, j=1,2,3) .\)</span> The invariance under the infinitesimal transformations of eqn (10.3.11) gives rise to the homogeneous equations <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i&lt;j} x_{i j} \frac{\partial G^{(3)}}{\partial x_{i j}}\left[\left(b \cdot x_{i}\right)+\left(b \cdot x_{j}\right)\right]=-\sum_{i} d_{i}\left(b \cdot x_{i}\right) G^{(3)}\]</span> whose solution is given by <span class="math display">\[\left\langle Q_{a}\left(x_{1}\right) Q_{b}\left(x_{2}\right) Q_{c}\left(x_{3}\right)\right\rangle=\frac{C_{a b c}}{x_{12}^{d_{3}-d_{1}-d_{2}} x_{13}^{d_{2}-d_{1}-d_{3}} x_{23}^{d_{1}-d_{2}-d_{3}}}\]</span> The numerical constant <span class="math inline">\(C_{a b c}\)</span> cannot be fixed by the conformal invariance.

In this case, in fact, the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> -point correlation functions can have an arbitrary dependence on the <span class="math inline">\(N(N-3) / 2\)</span> harmonic ratios. For instance, the general form of the four-point function can be expressed as <span class="math display">\[G^{(4)}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}\right)=F\left(\frac{x_{12} x_{34}}{x_{13} x_{24}}, \frac{x_{12} x_{34}}{x_{23} x_{41}}\right) \prod_{i&lt;j} x_{i j}^{-\left(d_{i}+d_{j}\right)+d / 2}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(d=\sum_{i=1}^{4} d_{i}\)</span> whereas <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is an arbitrary function of the two independent harmonic ratios. For <span class="math inline">\(D \neq 2\)</span> and in the absence of additional information, the explicit expression of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> cannot be determined. As we will see in the next sections, this goal can, however, be achieved when <span class="math inline">\(D=2\)</span>.</p><h3 id="two-dimensional-conformal-transformations">5 Two-dimensional Conformal Transformations</h3><p>Let's consider in more detail the conformal transformations in a euclidean space when <span class="math inline">\(D=2 .\)</span> In this case, something remarkable happens: in fact, eqns <span class="math inline">\((10.3 .5)\)</span> become <span class="math display">\[\partial_{1} \epsilon_{1}=\partial_{2} \epsilon_{2}, \quad \partial_{1} \epsilon_{2}=-\partial_{2} \epsilon_{1}\]</span> i.e. the Cauchy-Riemann conditions relative to the functions of a complex variable!

Heavy electron materials are a class of strongly correlated electron material containing localized magnetic moments which, by entangling with the surrounding electrons, profoundly transform the metallic properties. A heavy fermion metal can develop electron masses 1000 times that of copper, it can also develop unconventional superconductivity, transform into new forms of quantum order, exhibit quantum critical and topological behavior. Although most of these properties develop well below the boiling point of nitrogen, the diversity and highly tunable nature of their groundstates make them an invaluable vital work-horse for exploring and researching the emergent properties of correlated quantum matter.</p><p>This lecture will give an introduction to heavy fermion materials, trying to emphasize a <span class="math inline">\(21 st\)</span> century perspective. More extensive discussion and development of the ideas in these notes can be found in an earlier review article [1] and the latter chapters of my book "Introduction to Many Body Physics" [2].</p><p><img src="http://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/CMP_heavyFermion.jpg" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><p>In the periodic table, the most strongly interacting electrons reside in orbitals that are welllocalized. In order of increasing localization, partially filled orbitals are ordered as follows: <span class="math display">\[5 d&lt;4 d&lt;3 d&lt;5 f&lt;4 f\]</span> In addition, when moving along a row of the periodic table, the increasing nuclear charge pulls the orbitals towards the nucleus. These trends are summarized in the "Kmetko-Smith diagram" [3] in Fig 1. The d-orbital metals at the bottom left of this diagram are highly itinerant and exhibit conventional superconductivity. By contrast, in rare earth and actinide metals towards the top right-hand corner, the f-shell electrons are localized, forming magnets or antiferromagnets. It is the materials that lie in the cross-over between these two regions that are particularly interesting, for these materials are "on the brink of magnetism". It is in this crossover region that many strongly correlated materials reside: it is here for instance, that we find cerium and uranium, which are key atoms for a wide range of <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5 f\)</span> heavy electron materials.</p><h3 id="局域动量和近藤效应">局域动量和近藤效应</h3><p>Heavy electron materials contain a lattice of localized electrons immersed in a sea of mobile conduction electrons. To understand their physics, we need to first step back and discuss individual localized moments, and the mechanism by which they interact with the surrounding conduction sea.</p><p>The key feature of a localized moment, is that the Coulomb interaction has eliminated the high frequency charge fluctuations, leaving behind a low energy manifold of degenerate spin states. In rare earth and actinide ions, the orbital and spin angular momentum combine into a single entity with angular momentum <span class="math inline">\(\vec{j}=\vec{l}+\vec{s} .\)</span> For example, a <span class="math inline">\(C e^{3+}\)</span> ion contains a single unpaired 4f-electron in the state <span class="math inline">\(4 f^{1}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(l=3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s=1 / 2\)</span>.

(Fig. 2 a and b.)</p><figure><img src="http://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210107220451827.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" alt="" /><figcaption>image-20210107220451827</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Fig. 2: (a) In isolation, the localized atomic states of an atom form a stable, sharp excitation lying below the continuum. (b) In a crystal, the <span class="math inline">\(2 j+1\)</span> fold degenerate state splits into multiplets, typically forming a low lying Kramers doublet. (c) The inverse of the Curie-Weiss susceptibility of local moments <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> is a linear function of temperature, intersecting zero at <span class="math inline">\(T=-\theta\)</span>.</p></blockquote><p>One of the classic signatures of localized moments, is a high temperature Curie Weiss susceptibility, given by <span class="math display">\[\chi \approx n_{i} \frac{M^{2}}{3(T+\theta)} \quad M^{2}=g^{2} \mu_{B}^{2} j(j+1)\]</span> where, <span class="math inline">\(n_{i}\)</span> is the concentration of magnetic moments while <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the magnetic moment with total angular momentum quantum number <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and gyro-magnetic ratio ("g-factor") <span class="math inline">\(g . \theta\)</span> is the "Curie Weiss" temperature, a phenomenological scale which takes account of interactions between spins. The presence of such local moments inside a metal profoundly alters its properties. The physics of an isolated magnetic ion is described by the Kondo model <span class="math display">\[H=\sum_{k \sigma} \epsilon_{k} c^{\dagger}{ }_{k \sigma} c_{k \sigma}+ J \psi^{\dagger}(0) \vec{\sigma} \psi(0) \cdot \vec{S}_{f}  \]</span> where</p><ul><li><span class="math inline">\(c^{\dagger}{ }_{k \sigma}\)</span> creates a conduction electron of energy <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{k},\)</span> momentum <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span></li><li><span class="math inline">\(\psi^{\dagger}(0)= N _{s}^{-1 / 2} \sum_{k} c^{\dagger} k \sigma\)</span> creates a conduction at the origin, where <span class="math inline">\(N _{s}\)</span> is the number of sites in the lattice.</li><li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta H=J \psi^{\dagger}(0) \vec{\sigma} \psi(0) \cdot \vec{S}_{f}\)</span></li></ul><p>The conduction sea interacts with local moment via an antiferromagnetic contact interaction of strength <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>. The antiferromagnetic sign <span class="math inline">\((J&gt;0)\)</span> of this interaction is an example of "super-exchange", first predicted by Philip W. Anderson [4,5] , which results from high energy valence fluctuations. Jun Kondo [6] first analyzed the effect of this scattering, showing that as the temperature is lowered, the effective strength of the interaction grows logarithmically, according to <span class="math display">\[J \rightarrow J(T)=J+2 J^{2} \rho \ln \frac{D}{T}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the density of states of the conduction sea (per spin) and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the band-width. The growth of this interaction enabled Kondo to understand why in many metals at low temperatures, the resistance starts to rise as the temperature is lowered, giving rise to resistance minimum.</p><p>Today, we understand this logarithmic correction as a renormalization of the Kondo coupling constant, resulting from fact that as the temperature is lowered, more and more high frequency quantum spin fluctuations become coherent, and these strengthen the Kondo interaction. The effect is closely analogous to the growth of the strong-interaction between quarks, and like quarks, the local moment in the Kondo effect is asymptotically free at high energies. However, as you can see from the above equation, once the temperature becomes of order <span class="math display">\[T_{K} \sim D \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2 J \rho}\right]\]</span> the correction becomes as large as the original perturbation, and at lower temperatures, the Kondo interaction can no longer be treated perturbatively. In fact, non-perturbative methods tell us that this interaction scales to strong coupling at low energies, causing electrons in the conduction sea to magnetically screen the local moment to form an inert Kondo singlet denoted by <span class="math display">\[|G S\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow \downarrow\rangle-|\downarrow \uparrow\rangle)\]</span> where the thick arrow refers to the spin state of the local moment and the thin arrow refers to the spin state of a bound-electron at the site of the local moment. The key features of the impurity Kondo effect are are:</p><ul><li><p>The electron fluid surrounding the Kondo singlet forms a Fermi liquid, with a Pauli susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\chi \sim 1 / T_{K}\)</span></p></li><li><p>The local moment is a kind of qubit which entangles with the conduction sea to form a singlet. As the temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is raised, the entanglement entropy converts to thermal entropy, given by the integral of the specific heat coefficient, <span class="math display">\[S(T)=\int_{0}^{T} d T^{\prime} \frac{C_{V}\left(T^{\prime}\right)}{T^{\prime}}\]</span> Since the total area under the curve, <span class="math inline">\(S(T \rightarrow \infty)=R \ln 2\)</span> per mole is the high temperature spin entropy, and since the characteristic width is the Kondo temperature, it follows that the the characteristic zero temperature specific heat coefficient must be of order the inverse Kondo temperature: <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=\frac{C_{V}}{T}(T \rightarrow 0) \sim \frac{R \ln 2}{T_{K}} .\)</span> (See Fig. <span class="math inline">\(3 b\)</span> )</p></li><li><p>The only scale in the physics is <span class="math inline">\(T_{K} .\)</span> For example, the resistivity created by magnetic scattering off the impurity has a universal temperature dependence <span class="math display">\[\frac{R(T)}{R_{U}}=n_{i} \Phi\left(\frac{T}{T_{K}}\right)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n_{i}\)</span> is the concentration of magnetic impurities, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(x)\)</span> is a universal function and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{U}\)</span> is the unit of unitary resistance (basically resistance with a scattering rate of order the Fermi energy), <span class="math display">\[R_{U}=\frac{2 n e^{2}}{\pi m \rho}\]</span> Experiment confirms that the resistivity in the Kondo effect can indeed be scaled onto a single curve that fits forms derived from the Kondo model (see Fig 4).</p></li><li><p>The scattering off the Kondo singlet is resonantly confined to a narrow region of order <span class="math inline">\(T_{K},\)</span> called the Kondo or Abriksov-Suhl resonance.</p></li></ul><h2 id="最简单的重费米子近藤晶格">2 最简单的重费米子：近藤晶格</h2><p>In many ways, the Kondo insulator is the simplest ground-state of the Kondo lattice.

In this way, the half-filled strong coupling Kondo lattice forms an insulator with a charge gap of size <span class="math inline">\(3 J\)</span> and a spin gap of size <span class="math inline">\(2 J\)</span>. Notice finally that if we dope the insulator with an amount <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> of holes, we form a band of heavy fermions. In this way, Kondo insulators can be considered the parent states of heavy electron materials. However, we'd like to examine the physics of a Kondo lattice at weak coupling, and to do this requires a different approach.</p><h2 id="近藤晶格的大n展开">3 近藤晶格的大N展开</h2><p>One of the great difficulties with the Kondo lattice, is that there is no natural small parameter to carry out an approximate treatment. One way around this difficulty, is to use a large <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> expansion, in which we extend the number of spin components of the electrons from 2 to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Historically, Anderson [25] pointed out that the large spin-orbit coupling in heavy fermion compounds generates (if we ignore crystal fields) a large spin degeneracy <span class="math inline">\(N=2 j+1,\)</span> furnishing a small parameter <span class="math inline">\(1 / N\)</span> for a controlled expansion about the limit <span class="math inline">\(N \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. One of the observations arising from Anderson's idea [26,27] is that the RKKY interaction becomes negligible (of order <span class="math inline">\(\left.O\left(1 / N^{2}\right)\right)\)</span> in this limit and the Kondo lattice ground-state becomes stable. This observation opened the way to path integral mean-field treatments of the Kondo lattice <span class="math inline">\([27-32]\)</span> The basic idea of the large <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> limit is to examine a limit where every term in the Hamiltonian grows extensively with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. In the path integral for the partition function, the corresponding action then grows extensively with <span class="math inline">\(N,\)</span> so that <span class="math display">\[Z=\int D [\psi] e^{-N S}=\int D \psi \exp \left[-\frac{S}{1 / N}\right] \equiv \int D [\psi] \exp \left[-\frac{S}{\hbar_{e f f}}\right]\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{N} \sim \hbar_{\text {eff }}\)</span> behaves as an effective Planck's constant for the theory, focusing the path integral into a non-trivial "semi-classical" or "mean field" solution as <span class="math inline">\(\hbar_{e f f} \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> As <span class="math inline">\(N \rightarrow \infty,\)</span> the quantum fluctuations of intensive variables <span class="math inline">\(\hat{a},\)</span> such as the electron density per spin, become smaller and smaller, scaling as <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle\delta a^{2}\right\rangle /\left\langle a^{2}\right\rangle \sim 1 / N,\)</span> causing the path integral to focus around a non-trivial mean-field trajectory. In this way, one can obtain new results by expanding around the solvable large <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> limit in powers of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{N}\)</span>. (Fig. 8). We will use a simplified Kondo lattice model introduced by Read and Newns [27], in which all electrons have a spin degeneracy <span class="math inline">\(N=2 j+1,\)</span> <span class="math display">\[H=\sum_{ k \alpha} \epsilon_{ k } c_{ k \alpha}^{\dagger} c_{ k \alpha}+\frac{J}{N} \sum_{j, \alpha \beta} c^{\dagger}{ }_{j \beta} c_{j \alpha} S_{\alpha \beta}(j)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c^{\dagger}{ }_{j \alpha}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{s}}} \sum_{ k } c^{\dagger} k _{\alpha} e^{-i k \cdot \vec{R}_{j}}\)</span> creates an electron localized at site <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and the spin of the local moment at position <span class="math inline">\(R _{j}\)</span> is represented by pseudo-fermions <span class="math display">\[S_{\alpha \beta}(j)=f^{\dagger}{ }_{j \alpha} f_{j \beta}-\frac{n_{f}(j)}{N} \delta_{\alpha \beta}\]</span> This representation requires that we set a value for the conserved <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> occupancy <span class="math inline">\(n_{f}(j)=Q\)</span> at each site.

While currently available quantum computers have less than 100 qubits, quantum computing hardware is widely expected to grow in terms of qubit count, quality, and connectivity. This review aims to explain the principles of quantum programming, which are quite different from classical programming, with straightforward algebra that makes understanding of the underlying fascinating quantum mechanical principles optional. We give an introduction to quantum computing algorithms and their implementation on real quantum hardware. We survey 20 different quantum algorithms, attempting to describe each in a succinct and self-contained fashion. We show how these algorithms can be implemented on IBM's quantum computer, and in each case, we discuss the results of the implementation with respect to differences between the simulator and the actual hardware runs. This article introduces computer scientists, physicists, and engineers to quantum algorithms and provides a blueprint for their implementations.</p><h2 id="导论">1导论</h2><p>Quantum computing exploits quantum-mechanical effects-in particular superposition, entanglement, and quantum tunneling-to more efficiently execute a computation. Compared to traditional, digital computing, quantum computing offers the potential to dramatically reduce both execution time and energy consumption. These potential advantages, steady advances in nano-manufacturing, and the slow-down of traditional hardware scaling laws (such as Moore's Law) have led to a substantial commercial and national-security interest and investment in quantum computing technology in the 2010 s. Recently, Google announced that it has reached a major milestone known as quantum supremacy-the demonstration that a quantum computer can perform a calculation that is intractable on a classical supercomputer [8]. The problem tackled here by the quantum computer is not one with any direct real-world application. Nonetheless, this is a watershed moment for quantum computing and is widely seen as an important step on the road towards building quantum computers that will offer practical speedups when solving real-world problems [82]. (See [2] for a precise technical definition of quantum supremacy.)</p><p>While the mathematical basis of quantum computing, the programming model, and most quantum algorithms have been published decades ago (starting in the <span class="math inline">\(1990 s\)</span> ), they have been of interest only to a small dedicated community. We believe the time has come to make quantum algorithms and their implementations accessible to a broad swath of researchers and developers across computer science, software engineering, and other fields. The quantum programming model is fundamentally different from traditional computer programming. It is also dominated by physics and algebraic notations that at times present unnecessary entry barriers for mainstream computer scientists and other more mathematically trained scientists.</p><p>In this review, we provide a self-contained, succinct description of quantum computing and of the basic quantum algorithms with a focus on implementation. Since real quantum computers, such as <span class="math inline">\(IBM Q [55],\)</span> are now available as a cloud service, we present results from simulator and actual hardware experiments for smaller input data sets. Other surveys of quantum algorithms with a different target audience and also without actual implementations include [10,26,58,75,76,88] . Other cloud service based quantum computers are also available from Rigetti and IonQ, but in this review we will focus solely on IBM's quantum computing ecosystem. The code and implementations accompanying the paper can be found at <a href="https://github.com/lanl/quantum_algorithms." target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/lanl/quantum_algorithms.</a></p><h3 id="模型">1.1模型</h3><p>Here we provide a self-contained description of the quantum computing programming model. We will define the common terms and concepts used in quantum algorithms literature. We will not discuss how the constructs explained here are related to the foundations of quantum mechanics. Interested readers are encouraged to take a look at Ref. [77] for a more detailed account along those lines. Readers with a computer science background are referred to Refs. <span class="math inline">\([67,85,110],\)</span> for a more comprehensive introduction to quantum computing from a computer science perspective.</p><p>Quantum computing basically deals with the manipulation of quantum systems. The physical details of this is dependent on the quantum computer's hardware design. Here we will only talk about the higher level abstractions used in quantum computing: a typical programmer will only be exposed to these abstractions. The state of any quantum system is always represented by a vector in a complex vector space (usually called a Hilbert space). Quantum algorithms are always expressible as transformations acting on this vector space. These basic facts follow from the axioms of quantum mechanics. Now we will explain some of the basic concepts and terminology used in quantum computing.</p><h4 id="the-qubit.">1.1.1 The qubit.</h4><p>The qubit (short for 'quantum bit') is the fundamental information carrying unit used in quantum computers. It can be seen as the quantum mechanical generalization of a bit used in classical computers. More precisely, a qubit is a two dimensional quantum system. The state of a qubit can be expressed as, <span class="math display">\[|\phi\rangle=\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are complex numbers such that, <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha|^{2}+|\beta|^{2}=1\)</span>. In the ket-notation or the Dirac notation, <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\ 0\end{array}\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{l}0 \\ 1\end{array}\right)\)</span> are shorthands for the vectors encoding the two basis states of a two dimensional vector space. So according to this notation, Eq. (1) expresses the fact that the state of the qubit is the two dimensional complex vector <span class="math inline">\(\left(\begin{array}{l}\alpha \\ \beta\end{array}\right)\)</span>. Unlike a classical bit the state of a qubit cannot be measured without changing it. Measuring a qubit, whose state given by Eq. (1), will yield the classical value of either zero (|0) with probability <span class="math inline">\(|\alpha|^{2}\)</span> or one (<span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span>) with probability <span class="math inline">\(|\beta|^{2}\)</span>. Qubit implementations and technologies are a very active area of research that is not the focus of our review, an interested reader is referred to [65] for a survey.</p><h4 id="system-of-qubits.">1.1.2 System of qubits.</h4><p>The mathematical structure of a qubit generalizes to higher dimensional quantum systems as well. The state of any quantum system is a normalized vector (a vector of norm one) in a complex vector space. The normalization is necessary to ensure that the total probability of all the outcomes of a measurement sum to one.</p><p>A quantum computer contains many number of qubits. So it is necessary to know how to construct the combined state of a system of qubits given the states of the individual qubits. The joint state of a system of qubits is described using an operation known as the tensor product, <span class="math inline">\(\otimes\)</span>. Mathematically, taking the tensor product of two states is the same as taking the Kronecker product of their corresponding vectors. Say we have two single qubit states <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{l}\alpha \\ \beta\end{array}\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left|\phi^{\prime}\right\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{l}\alpha^{\prime} \\ \beta^{\prime}\end{array}\right)\)</span>. Then the full state of a system composed of two independent qubits is given by, <span class="math display">\[|\phi\rangle \otimes\left|\phi^{\prime}\right\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{l}\alpha \\\beta\end{array}\right) \otimes\left(\begin{array}{l}\alpha^{\prime} \\\beta^{\prime}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{l}\alpha \alpha^{\prime} \\\alpha \beta^{\prime} \\\beta \alpha^{\prime} \\\beta \beta^{\prime}\end{array}\right)\]</span> Sometimes the <span class="math inline">\(\otimes\)</span> symbol is dropped all together while denoting the tensor product to reduce clutter. Instead the states are written inside a single ket. For example, <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle \otimes\left|\phi^{\prime}\right\rangle\)</span> is shortened to <span class="math inline">\(\left|\phi \phi^{\prime}\right\rangle\)</span>, and |0<span class="math inline">\(\otimes|0\rangle \otimes|0\rangle\)</span> is shortened to |000. For larger systems the Dirac notation gives a more succinct way to compute the tensor product using the distributive property of the Kronecker product. For a system of, say, three qubits with each qubit in the state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\gamma_{j}\right\rangle=\alpha_{j}|0\rangle+\beta_{j}|1\rangle,\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(j=1,2,3,\)</span> the joint state is, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\left|\gamma_{1} \gamma_{2} \gamma_{3}\right\rangle=&amp;\left|\gamma_{1}\right\rangle \otimes\left|\gamma_{2}\right\rangle \otimes\left|\gamma_{3}\right\rangle \\=&amp; \alpha_{1} \alpha_{2} \alpha_{3}|000\rangle+\alpha_{1} \alpha_{2} \beta_{3}|001\rangle+\alpha_{1} \beta_{2} \alpha_{3}|010\rangle+\alpha_{1} \beta_{2} \beta_{3}|011\rangle \\&amp;+\beta_{1} \alpha_{2} \alpha_{3}|100\rangle+\beta_{1} \alpha_{2} \beta_{3}|101\rangle+\beta_{1} \beta_{2} \alpha_{3}|110\rangle+\beta_{1} \beta_{2} \beta_{3}|111\rangle\end{aligned}\]</span> A measurement of all three qubits could result in any of the eight <span class="math inline">\(\left(2^{3}\right)\)</span> possible bit-strings associated with the eight basis vectors. One can see from these examples that the dimension of the state space grows exponentially in the number of qubits <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and that the number of basis vectors is <span class="math inline">\(2^{n}\)</span>.</p><h4 id="section">1.1.3</h4><p>Superposition and entanglement. Superposition refers to the fact that any linear combination of two quantum states, once normalized, will also be a valid quantum state. The upshot to this is that any quantum state can be expressed as a linear combination of a few basis states. For example, we saw in Eq. (1) that any state of a qubit can be expressed as a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> . Similarly, the state of any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> qubit system can be written as a normalized linear combination of the <span class="math inline">\(2^{n}\)</span> bit-string states (states formed by the tensor products of <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle\)</span> 's and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle\)</span> 's). The orthonormal basis formed by the <span class="math inline">\(2^{n}\)</span> bit-string states is called the computational basis.</p><p>Notice that Eq. (3) described a system of three qubits whose complete state was the tensor product of three different single qubit states. But it is possible for three qubits to be in a state that cannot be written as the tensor product of three single qubit states. An example of such a state is, <span class="math display">\[|\psi\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|000\rangle+|111\rangle)\]</span> States of a system of which cannot be expressed as a tensor product of states of its individual subsystems are called entangled states. For a system of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> qubits, this means that an entalged state cannot be written a tensor product of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> single qubit states. The existence of entangled states is a physical fact that has important consequences for quantum computing, and quantum information processing in general. In fact, without the existence of such states quantum computers would be no more powerful than their classical counterparts [108]. Entanglement makes it possible to create a complete <span class="math inline">\(2^{n}\)</span> dimensional complex vector space to do our computations in, using just <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> physical qubits.</p><h4 id="inner-and-outer-products.">1.1.4 Inner and outer products.</h4><p>We will now discuss some linear algebraic notions necessary for understanding quantum algorithms. First of these is the inner product or overlap between two quantum states. As we have seen before, quantum states are vectors in complex vectors spaces. The overlap between two states is just the inner product between these complex vectors. For example, take two single qubit states, <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle=\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle=\gamma|0\rangle+\delta|1\rangle .\)</span> The overlap between these states is denoted in the ket notation as <span class="math inline">\(\langle\psi \mid \phi\rangle .\)</span> And this is given by, <span class="math display">\[\langle\psi \mid \phi\rangle=\gamma^{*} \alpha+\delta^{*} \beta\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> denotes the complex conjugate. Notice that, <span class="math inline">\(\langle\psi \mid \phi\rangle=\langle\phi \mid \psi\rangle^{*}\)</span>. The overlap of two states is in general a complex number. The overlap of a state with a bit-string state will produce the corresponding coefficient. For instance from Eq. <span class="math inline">\((1),\langle 0 \mid \phi\rangle=\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\langle 1 \mid \phi\rangle=\beta .\)</span> And from Eq. <span class="math inline">\((3),\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle 001 \mid \gamma_{1} \gamma_{2} \gamma_{3}\right\rangle=\alpha_{1} \alpha_{2} \beta_{3} .\)</span> Another way to look at overlaps between quantum states is by defining what is called a bra state. The states we have seen so far are ket states, like <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle\)</span>, which represented column vectors. A bra state corresponding to this ket state, written as <span class="math inline">\(\langle\phi|\)</span>, represents a row vector with complex conjugated entries. For instance <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{l}\alpha \\ \beta\end{array}\right)\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(\langle\phi|=\left(\alpha^{*} \quad \beta^{*}\right)\)</span>. The overlap of two states is then the matrix product of a row vector with a column vector, yielding a single number. The reader must have already noticed the wordplay here. The overlap, with its closing angled parenthesis, form a 'bra-ket'!</p><p>The outer product of two states is an important operation that outputs a matrix given two states. The outer product of the two states we defined above will be denoted by, <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\langle\phi| .\)</span> Mathematically the outer product of two states is a matrix obtained by multiplying the column vector of the first state with the complex conjugated row vector of the second state (notice how the ket is written before the bra to signify this). For example, <span class="math display">\[|\psi\rangle\langle\phi|=\left(\begin{array}{l}\alpha \\\beta\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ll}\gamma^{*} &amp; \delta^{*}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ll}\alpha \gamma^{*} &amp; \alpha \delta^{*} \\\beta \gamma^{*} &amp; \beta \delta^{*}\end{array}\right)\]</span> In this notation any matrix can be written as a linear combination of outer products between bit-string states. For a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> matrix, <span class="math display">\[A=\left(\begin{array}{ll}A_{00} &amp; A_{01} \\A_{10} &amp; A_{11}\end{array}\right)=A_{00}|0\rangle\left\langle 0\left|+A_{01}\right| 0\right\rangle\left\langle 1\left|+A_{10}\right| 1\right\rangle\left\langle 0\left|+A_{11}\right| 1\right\rangle\langle 1|\]</span> Acting on a state with a matrix then becomes just an exercise in computing overlaps between states. Let us demonstrate this process: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}A|\phi\rangle &amp;=A_{00}|0\rangle\langle 0 \mid \phi\rangle+A_{01}|0\rangle\langle 1 \mid \phi\rangle+A_{10}|1\rangle\langle 0 \mid \phi\rangle+A_{11}|1\rangle\langle 1 \mid \phi\rangle \\&amp;=\left(A_{00} \alpha+A_{01} \beta\right)|0\rangle+\left(A_{10} \alpha+A_{11} \beta\right)|1\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{l}A_{00} \alpha+A_{01} \beta \\A_{10} \alpha+A_{11} \beta\end{array}\right)\end{aligned}\]</span> This notation might look tedious at first glance but it makes algebraic manipulations of quantum states easily understandable. This is especially true when we are dealing with large number of qubits as otherwise we would have to explicitly write down exponentially large matrices.</p><h2 id="grover算法">2 Grover算法</h2><h3 id="problem-definition-and-background">2.1 Problem definition and background</h3><p>Grover's algorithm as initially described [52] enables one to find (with probability <span class="math inline">\(&gt;1 / 2\)</span> ) a specific item within a randomly ordered database of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> items using <span class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{N})\)</span> operations. By contrast, a classical computer would require <span class="math inline">\(O(N)\)</span> operations to achieve this. Therefore, Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup over an optimal classical algorithm. It has also been shown [14] that Grover's algorithm is optimal in the sense that no quantum Turing machine can do this in less than <span class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt{N})\)</span> operations.</p><p>While Grover's algorithm is commonly thought of as being useful for searching a database, the basic ideas that comprise this algorithm are applicable in a much broader context. This approach can be used to accelerate search algorithms where one could construct a "quantum oracle" that distinguishes the needle from the haystack. The needle and hay need not be part of a database. For example, it could be used to search for two integers <span class="math inline">\(1&lt;a&lt;b\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(a b=n\)</span> for some number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> resulting in a factoring algorithm. Grover's search in this case would have worse performance than Shor's algorithm [93,94] described below, which is a specialised algorithm to solve the factoring problem. Implementing the quantum oracle can be reduced to constructing a quantum circuit that flips an ancillary qubit, <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> if a function, <span class="math inline">\(f(x),\)</span> evaluates to 1 for an input <span class="math inline">\(x .\)</span> We use the term ancilla or ancillary qubit to refer to some extra qubits that are used by the algorithm. The function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is defined by <span class="math display">\[f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1 &amp; \text { if } x=x^{*} \\0 &amp; \text { if } x \neq x^{*}\end{array}\right.\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x =x_{1} x_{2} \ldots x_{n}\)</span> are binary strings and <span class="math inline">\(x ^{*}\)</span> is the specific string that is being sought. It may seem paradoxical at first that an algorithm for finding <span class="math inline">\(x^{*}\)</span> is needed if such a function can be constructed. The key here is that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> need only recognize <span class="math inline">\(x^{*}-\)</span> it is similar to the difference between writing down an equation and solving an equation. For example, it is easy to check if the product of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(n,\)</span> but harder to factor <span class="math inline">\(n .\)</span> In essence, Grover's algorithm can invert an arbitrary function with binary outputs, provided we have a quantum oracle that implements the function. Grover's algorithm has been used, with appropriate oracles, to solve problems like finding triangles in a graph <span class="math inline">\([72],\)</span> finding cycles <span class="math inline">\([28],\)</span> and finding maximal cliques <span class="math inline">\([109] .\)</span> For the analysis of Grover's algorithm, the internals of the oracle is typically considered a black-box. Often, the oracle operator for the problem at hand has to be constructed as a quantum circuit. But, keep in mind that an inefficient oracle construction can nullify any practical advantages gained by using Grover's search.</p><p>Here we implement a simple instance of Grover's algorithm. That is, the quantum oracle we utilize is a very simple one. Let <span class="math inline">\(x =x_{1} x_{2}\)</span> and we wish to find <span class="math inline">\(x ^{*}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x_{1}^{*}=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_{2}^{*}=1 .\)</span> While finding such an <span class="math inline">\(x^{*}\)</span> is trivial, we don a veil of ignorance and proceed as if it were not. This essentially means that our function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is an AND gate. But AND gate is not reversible and cannot be a quantum gate. However the Toffoli gate, that was introduced in the previous section, is a reversible version of the classical AND gate. The Toffoli gate takes three bits as input and outputs three bits. The first two bits are unmodified. The third bit is flipped if the first two bits are <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> The unitary matrix corresponding to the Toffoli gate can be found in Table <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> In other words, the Toffoli gate implements our desired quantum oracle where the first two inputs are <span class="math inline">\(x_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_{2}\)</span> and the third bit is the ancillary bit, <span class="math inline">\(q .\)</span> The behavior of the oracle in general is <span class="math inline">\(| x \rangle|q\rangle \rightarrow| x \rangle|f( x ) \bigoplus q\rangle,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\bigoplus\)</span> is the XOR operation. Here we will only discuss the case where <span class="math inline">\(x^{*}\)</span> is unique. Grover's algorithm can also be used to search for multiple items in a database.</p><h3 id="algorithm-description">2.2 Algorithm description</h3><p>Here we present a brief introduction to Grover's algorithm. A more detailed account can be found in Nielsen and Chuang <span class="math inline">\([77] .\)</span> Let <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> be the number of items (represented as bit strings) amongst which we are performing the search. This number will also be equal to the dimension of the vector space we are working with. An operator, called the Grover operator or the diffusion operator, is the key piece of machinery in Grover's algorithm. This operator is defined by <span class="math display">\[G=(2|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|-I) O\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{i}|i\rangle\)</span> is the uniform superposition over all the basis states and <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> is the oracle operator (see Fig. 6 for a representation of this operator in the case where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> consists of 2 bits). The action of <span class="math inline">\((2|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|-I)\)</span> on an arbitrary state, given by <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i} a_{i}|i\rangle,\)</span> when decomposed over the basis states is, <span class="math display">\[(2|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|-I) \sum_{i} a_{i}|i\rangle=\sum_{i}\left(2\langle a\rangle-a_{i}\right)|i\rangle\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\langle a\rangle=\frac{\sum_{i} a_{i}}{N}\)</span> is the average amplitude in the basis states. From Eq. (34) one can see that the amplitude of each <span class="math inline">\(|i\rangle\)</span> -state <span class="math inline">\(\left(a_{i}\right)\)</span> is flipped about the mean amplitude.</p><p>In order to use the Grover operator to successfully perform a search, the qubit register must be appropriately initialized. The initialization is carried out by applying a Hadamard transform to each of the the main qubits <span class="math inline">\(\left(H^{\otimes n}\right)\)</span> and applying a Pauli X transform followed by a Hadamard transform <span class="math inline">\((H X)\)</span> to the ancilla. This leaves the main register in the uniform superposition of all states, <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle\)</span>, and the ancilla in the state <span class="math inline">\(\frac{|0\rangle-|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span>. After performing these operations, the system is in the state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle \frac{|0\rangle-|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span>. Using Eq. (34), we can now understand how the Grover operator works. The action of the oracle operator on <span class="math inline">\(\left| x ^{*}\right\rangle \frac{|0\rangle-|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span> reverses the amplitude of that state <span class="math display">\[O\left| x ^{*}\right\rangle \frac{|0\rangle-|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \rightarrow\left| x ^{*}\right\rangle \frac{\left.\left|f\left( x ^{*}\right) \bigoplus 0\right\rangle-\left|f\left( x ^{*}\right) \bigoplus 1\right\rangle\right)}{\sqrt{2}}=\left| x ^{*}\right\rangle \frac{|1\rangle-|0\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}=-\left| x ^{*}\right\rangle \frac{|0\rangle-|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\]</span> A similar argument shows that all other states are unmodified by the oracle operator. Combining this with Eq. (34) reveals why the Grover operator is able to successfully perform a search. Consider what happens on the first iteration: The oracle operator makes it so that the amplitude of <span class="math inline">\(\left| x ^{*}\right\rangle\)</span> is below <span class="math inline">\(\langle a\rangle\)</span> (using the notation of Eq. (34)) while all the other states have an amplitude that is slightly above <span class="math inline">\(\langle a\rangle\)</span>. The effect of applying <span class="math inline">\(2|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|-I\)</span> is then to make <span class="math inline">\(\left| x ^{*}\right\rangle\)</span> have an amplitude above the mean while all other states have an amplitude below the mean. The desired behavior of the Grover</p><p>operator is to increase the amplitude of <span class="math inline">\(\left| x ^{*}\right\rangle\)</span> while decreasing the amplitude of the other states. If the Grover operator is applied too many times, this will eventually stop happening. The Grover operator should be applied exactly <span class="math inline">\(\left[\frac{\pi \sqrt{N}}{4}\right]\)</span> times after which a measurement will reveal <span class="math inline">\(x ^{*}\)</span> with probability close to <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> In the case where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> has two bits, a single application of Grover's operator is sufficient to find <span class="math inline">\(x^{*}\)</span> with certainty (in theory). Below is a high level pseudocode for the algorithm. <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l}\hline \text { Algorithm } 1 \text { Grover&#39;s algorithm } \\\hline \text { Input: } \\\text { - An Oracle operator effecting the transformation }|x\rangle|q\rangle \rightarrow|x\rangle|q \oplus f(x)\rangle . \\\text { Output: } \\\text { - The unique bit string } x ^{*} \text { satisfying Eq. }(32) \\\text { Procedure: } \\\text { Step } 1 . \text { Perform state initialization }|0 \ldots 0\rangle \rightarrow|\psi\rangle\left(\frac{|0\rangle-|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \\\text { Step } 2 . \text { Apply Grover operator } \left.\mid \frac{\pi \sqrt{N}}{4}\right] \text { times } \\\text { Step } 3 . \text { Perform measurement on all qubit except the ancillary qubit. }\end{array}\]</span></p><h3 id="algorithm-implemented-on-ibms-5-qubit-computer">2.3 Algorithm implemented on IBM's 5-qubit computer</h3><p>Fig. 7 shows the circuit that was designed to fit the ibmqx 4 quantum computer.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[TOC]</p><h2 id="摘要">摘要</h2><p>We analyze the dynamics of entanglement entropy in a generic quantum many-body open system from the perspective of quantum information and error corrections. We introduce a random unitary circuit model with intermittent projective measurements, in which the degree of information scrambling by the unitary and the rate of projective measurements are independently controlled. This model displays two stable phases, characterized by the volume-law and area-law scaling entanglement entropy in steady states. The transition between the two phases is understood from the point of view of quantum error correction: the chaotic unitary evolution protects quantum information from projective measurements that act as errors. A phase transition occurs when the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that depends on the degree of information scrambling. We confirm these results using numerical simulations and obtain the phase diagram of our model. Our work shows that information scrambling plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of entanglement in an open quantum system and relates the entanglement phase transition to changes in quantum channel capacity.</p><h2 id="近况背景">近况背景</h2><p>A generic unitary evolution of a quantum many-body system scrambles information. Any local degrees of freedom that are initially in an unentangled state become increasingly more entangled with the rest of the system, making the information encoded in them effectively unrecoverable <span class="math inline">\([1-3] . \quad\)</span> The scrambling dynamics <span class="math inline">\([4-7],\)</span> evidenced by the growth of the entanglement entropy toward an extensive value <span class="math inline">\([8-11],\)</span> underlies the rich complexity of quantum dynamics and the fact that simulating it is beyond the capability of classical computers.</p><p>In a realistic system, however, unitary dynamics is often interspersed by occasional measurements of local observables made by external observers either controlled or accidental. This process disentangles the measured degrees of freedom from the rest of the system, which may reduce the entanglement entropy. Thus, it is natural to ask under what conditions the growth of entanglement is tamed to a point allowing efficient classical simulations of the quantum dynamics [12,13] .</p><p>This question has been addressed in a number of recent works. In the special case of noninteracting fermions, quantum states with volume scaling entanglement (volume-law phase) are unstable to any small rate of measurements in local occupation basis, leading to steady states in which the entropy only scales with the boundary area of a region (area-law phase) <span class="math inline">\([14] .\)</span> However, the corresponding behavior in generic interacting systems appears to be much more subtle and has not been fully understood. On the one hand, Refs. <span class="math inline">\([15-17]\)</span> suggested that the interplay between the unitary dynamics and measurements can lead to a transition between two distinct phases: for sufficiently small measurement rates, the system remains stable in the volume-law phase, while it undergoes a transition into an area-law phase as the rate exceeds a certain critical value. On the other hand, in its early version, Ref. [17] pointed out that this phase transition cannot be explained by a simple competition between rates of entanglement growth and measurements, as it would always predict the area-law phase for nonzero measurement rates.</p><p>In this Letter, we show that a central ingredient for understanding the entanglement phase transition is the effective quantum error correction enabled by scrambling unitary dynamics. Using simple concepts from quantum information theory, we provide new insight on the mechanism that drives the phase transition. Naively, the phase transition seems to hinge on the competition between the rate of entanglement generation by unitary gates and that of disentanglement by measurements. If this perspective is true, the volume-law phase is unstable against an arbitrarily small rate of measurements since the competition is fundamentally not symmetric. Given a bipartition, a local unitary gate may change the entanglement only when it acts nontrivially across the boundary of two subsystems. In contrast, the effect of the measurements could be nonlocal: by disentangling all of the measured qubits inside a subsystem, the rate of entanglement reduction may be extensive. Thus, measurements would always overwhelm the entanglement generation and destabilize the volume-law phase. Here, we argue that this is not the case when information scrambling is taken into account.</p><p>Our key observation is that nonlocal effects of sparse measurements are greatly suppressed due to the natural quantum error correction (QEC) property of scrambling dynamics. If quantum information is sufficiently scrambled by unitary evolution, correlations between two subsystems are hidden in highly nonlocal degrees of freedom and cannot be revealed by any local measurements. In such case, sparse local measurements, despite their extensive number, cannot decrease the entanglement entropy significantly. To illustrate this point and quantify the condition under which the entanglement is robustly protected against local measurements, we improve and apply the quantum decoupling theorem to a specially constructed toy model <span class="math inline">\([18,19],\)</span> showing the stability of the volume-law phase. We find that the mechanism of the protection is equivalent to that of the QEC scheme <span class="math inline">\([18-\)</span> 20]. Motivated by this understanding, we introduce a new model and analyze its dynamics both analytically and numerically to obtain the phase diagram. Furthermore, we establish an exact relation between the steadystate entanglement entropy and the quantum channel capacity of quantum dynamics.</p><p>Protection against measurement.-We now illustrate how entanglement can be protected against measurements using a well-studied toy example from quantum information theory <span class="math inline">\([19,21-23] .\)</span> Consider a system of <span class="math inline">\(2 N\)</span> qubits <span class="math inline">\((N \gg 1)\)</span> as shown in Fig. 1. Initially, the two halves of the system, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> share <span class="math inline">\(\gamma N\)</span> Bell pairs <span class="math inline">\((0&lt;\gamma&lt;1),\)</span> which control the amount of the entanglement between the two. The two subsystems are evolved independently with unitaries <span class="math inline">\(U_{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_{B},\)</span> respectively. We assume <span class="math inline">\(U_{A}\)</span> is a random unitary drawn from the Haar distribution (or any unitary 2 -design), and <span class="math inline">\(U_{B}\)</span> can be arbitrary. Following this evolution, a fraction <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the qubits in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is measured. The pertinent question is by how much these measurements reduce the entanglement between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. We shall show that under a certain condition the change of entanglement entropy due to the measurements vanishes in the thermodynamic limit even though an extensive number of qubits are being disentangled. Note that this result can be generalized to incorporate measurements performed on both <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> by sequentially analyzing the effect of measurements.</p><p>We first simplify the problem. since <span class="math inline">\(U_{B}\)</span> does not affect the entanglement, we may replace <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> with its minimal effective degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{B}\)</span> entangled with <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> i.e., the original <span class="math inline">\(\gamma N\)</span> entangled qubits. Also, we divide <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> into two parts: subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A_{1}\)</span> refers to the unmeasured qubits and subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A_{2}\)</span> contains the measured ones. We now apply the decoupling theorem <span class="math inline">\([19,21-23]\)</span> to this setup, which will imply that, for a sufficiently small measurement fraction <span class="math inline">\(p,\)</span> the reduced density matrix of <span class="math inline">\(A_{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{B}\)</span> approximately factorizes <span class="math display">\[E _{U_{A}}\left[\left\|\rho_{A_{2} \tilde{B}}\left(U_{A}\right)-\rho_{A_{2}}^{\max } \otimes \rho_{\tilde{B}}\right\|_{1}\right] \leq 2^{-(1-2 p-\gamma) N / 2}\]</span> Here, the left-hand side denotes the distance, in the <span class="math inline">\(L_{1}\)</span> norm, between the exact density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A_{2} \tilde{B}}\)</span> and a factorized one where <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A_{2}}^{\max }\)</span> is the maximally mixed state on the measured part <span class="math inline">\(A_{2} . \quad E _{U}[\cdot]\)</span> represents averaging over the random unitaries. The inequality implies that the measured qubits are effectively decoupled from <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{B}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(N \gg 1,\)</span> provided that the number of unmeasured qubits <span class="math inline">\(A_{1}\)</span> is more than half of the total system <span class="math inline">\(A \tilde{B},\)</span> or equivalently <span class="math display">\[\gamma+p&lt;\frac{1}{2}(1+\gamma)\]</span> or simply <span class="math inline">\(\gamma&lt;1-2 p .\)</span> If this inequality is satisfied, then any observable in <span class="math inline">\(A_{2}\)</span> contains no information about <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{B}\)</span> and vice versa. Therefore, measuring one subsystem does not affect the other, up to an error exponentially small in <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. In particular, any projection (due to measurements) acting on <span class="math inline">\(A_{2}\)</span> does not alter <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{\tilde{B}},\)</span> and the entanglement entropy of subsystem <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is unchanged. In fact, one can show that even the initial <span class="math inline">\(\gamma N\)</span> Bell pairs can be reconstructed by local operations in <span class="math inline">\(A_{1}\)</span> with an exponentially good precision [20].</p><p>The inequality in Eq. (2) is enough to prove the stability of volume-law scaling of the entanglement entropy in the presence of extensive number of measurements. However, it is not tight. This is because in deriving the inequality we assumed that qubits in <span class="math inline">\(A_{2}\)</span> are discarded (i.e., qubit loss errors , whereas in our situation they are projectively measured, leaving their measurement outcomes as accessible classical information. In [24], we develop an improved decoupling equality, in which the measurement outcomes from <span class="math inline">\(A_{2}\)</span> are treated as accessible information. This leads to a tight bound <span class="math display">\[\gamma&lt;1-p\]</span> in the limit <span class="math inline">\(N \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. This inequality can be saturated by typical Haar random unitaries. An intuitive way to understand this new result is to realize that the measurement processes of <span class="math inline">\(p N\)</span> qubits involve entangling those qubits with an equal number of auxiliary qubits representing the environment (or classical measurement devices). These additional degrees of freedom effectively add to the right-hand side of Eq. (2), i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\gamma+p&lt;(1+\gamma+p) / 2,\)</span> leading to the tight bound.</p><p>So far, we have considered an ideal situation where the Bell pairs are hidden over the entire Hilbert space via a nonlocal unitary. However, we emphasize that such information scrambling is a generic property of quantum dynamics even in local systems <span class="math inline">\([8-11,25] .\)</span> In such cases, we expect that the amount of entanglement reduction is governed by the competition between the rate of effective information scrambling and that of projective measurements.</p><p>Model and phase diagram.- Having understood the mechanism to protect the entanglement against measurements through scrambling, we turn to study a local <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> model in which the rates of effective information scrambling and measurements can be tuned independently.</p><p>Our model consists of a chain of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> blocks, each containing a fixed number, <span class="math inline">\(m \gg 1,\)</span> of qubits, as illustrated in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2( a ) .\)</span> In each time step <span class="math inline">\(t,\)</span> the system is evolved by a network of random unitaries <span class="math inline">\(U_{d}(i, t)\)</span> acting on pairs of neighboring blocks at <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i+1,\)</span> supplemented by projective measurements. Crucially, the unitaries <span class="math inline">\(U_{d}(i, t)\)</span> are constructed from an internal network consisting of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> layers of independent random 2 -qubit gates (drawn from any unitary 2 -design). Thus, the parameter <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> controls the degree of information scrambling within a single <span class="math inline">\(U_{d}(i, t),\)</span> which becomes maximally scrambling in the limit <span class="math inline">\(d / m \gg 1\)</span>. In this limit the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(U_{d}(i, t)\)</span> approaches a unitary 2 -design over <span class="math inline">\(U \left(2^{2 m}\right)[25] .\)</span> After applications of the <span class="math inline">\(U_{d}(i, t)\)</span> on pairs of blocks, a fraction <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the qubits in each block is randomly chosen to be measured in the computational basis [26]. We note that the special case of our model, <span class="math inline">\(d=1,\)</span> is closely related to the previously studied ones <span class="math inline">\([15-17]\)</span>.</p><p>Before obtaining a quantitative phase diagram from numerical simulations [Fig. $2( e )],$ one can already predict the stability of volume-law phase in the limit <span class="math inline">\(m \gg 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d / m \gg 1 .\)</span> Consider the unitary evolution <span class="math inline">\(U_{d}(i, t)\)</span> for a pair of blocks. If we identify the pair of blocks as subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the rest of the system as <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> we can use the decoupling inequality as discussed above. As long as the average entropy per qubit <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> satisfies the criteria in Eq. (3), the measured qubits contain almost no information about the rest of the system (up to corrections exponentially small in <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> ). Here, the entanglement reduction is suppressed by information scrambling within the blocks. Over multiple time steps, quantum information becomes scrambled over a larger region, further protecting the entanglement from measurements. Thus we expect a stable volume-law phase in this regime.</p><p>We can also make a definitive statement about the other extreme of small <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and high measurement rate. For example, consider <span class="math inline">\(d=1, m \gg 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p=1-1 / m .\)</span> In this case there is no room for scrambling; thus, the probability that a single qubit becomes entangled to other qubits at distance <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> away (in units of qubit blocks) is exponentially suppressed as <span class="math inline">\(\sim(1 / m)^{m x}\)</span> because the information encoded in the qubit needs to propagate without being projected at least <span class="math inline">\(\sim m x\)</span> time steps. This implies area-law entanglement [14]. Therefore, we expect a phase transition between the two extreme cases.</p><p>We now complement the theoretical arguments with, a numerical simulation of the half-chain entanglement entropy <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> starting from the initial state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Psi_{0}\right\rangle=|0\rangle^{\otimes m L}\)</span> We construct the unitary operators <span class="math inline">\(U_{d}(i, t)\)</span> from random 2-qubit Clifford gates drawn from a uniform distribution instead of taking Haar random unitaries. Such <span class="math inline">\(U_{d}(i, t)\)</span> still approaches a unitary 2 -design as <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> increases [24] ; hence, this simplification does not affect our predictions, while allowing scalable numerical simulation [2730]. Furthermore, the wave function evolved under Clifford gates always exhibits a flat entanglement spectrum with respect to any bipartition. Thus, different measures of entanglement entropy, e.g. von Neumann versus Rényi entropies, yield the same value. In the following, we focus on <span class="math inline">\(m=11\)</span>.</p><p>We first consider a strongly scrambling regime, <span class="math inline">\(d /(2 m) \gtrsim 1,\)</span> where the unitary network within a single block effectively acts as a random <span class="math inline">\(2^{2 m} \times 2^{2 m}\)</span> unitary <span class="math inline">\([24,25] .\)</span> We test if the scrambling property of individual blocks leads to the robust volume-law entanglement of the entire system. Figures <span class="math inline">\(2( b )\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2( c )\)</span> show the detailed dynamics of the entanglement entropy for two different system sizes. Clearly, the entropy rescaled by the subsystem size exhibits a strict linear growth until it saturates to a constant value. The convergence of these values confirms the volume-law scaling of the entropy [24]. Moreover, we can directly compute how much the entanglement entropy changes, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S_{\text {meas }}(t),\)</span> following projective measurements in each time step. Figure <span class="math inline">\(2( c )\)</span> confirms our prediction that in the strongly scrambling regime <span class="math inline">\(d /(2 m) \gtrsim 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m \gg 1,\)</span> the entanglement is unchanged by measurements until it reaches a saturation value set by the maximal entanglement that can be protected by the scrambling dynamics [31]. Once saturated, the entanglement added by the unitary gates pushes the entropy above the threshold of the decoupling theorem and it is reduced back to the saturation value by the subsequent measurements. Thus, upon reaching the saturation value we see a jump of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S_{\text {meas }}\)</span> from near zero to a negative value. We further note that the saturation value approaches its maximum, <span class="math inline">\(1-p,\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is increased in this regime [Fig. $2( d )] .$ This is natural since our tight bound in Eq. (3) becomes exact when <span class="math inline">\(m \rightarrow \infty,\)</span> and it predicts that each qubit on average contributes <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=1-p\)</span> to the global entanglement. We note that this analysis does not hold in the weakly scrambling regime <span class="math inline">\(d /(2 m) \lesssim 1,\)</span> e.g., <span class="math inline">\(d=3, m=11[\)</span> Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2( d )]\)</span></p><p>We now turn to the phase transition that occurs when <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is decreased or <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is increased. From numerical simulations, we compute the half-chain entanglement per qubit and tripartite mutual information in the steady state for various <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> for a fixed <span class="math inline">\(d[24] .\)</span> We perform a finite size scaling analysis in order to extract the critical measurement fraction <span class="math inline">\(p_{c}\)</span> as well as the correlation length critical exponent <span class="math inline">\(\nu[15,32] .\)</span> By repeating the analysis for various values of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, we obtain a two-dimensional phase diagram shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2( e ) .\)</span> We find that the fitted critical exponent <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> has a universal value around 1.2 independent of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> suggesting the universality of the transition [24]. When <span class="math inline">\(d=1\)</span> the extracted critical value <span class="math inline">\(p_{c} \approx 0.16\)</span> is consistent with previously reported results <span class="math inline">\([16,33] .\)</span> More importantly, we find that the volume-law entangled phase extends to a higher measurement fraction, as <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> increases to <span class="math inline">\(\sim m,\)</span> and then saturates for <span class="math inline">\(d /(2 m) \gtrsim 1\)</span>.</p><p>Discussion. - The existence of the stable volume-law phase has a direct interpretation in terms of QEC for quantum communications <span class="math inline">\([18],\)</span> where the primary goal is to devise an encoding scheme to transfer the maximum amount of quantum information over a noisy or lossy channel. The maximum amount of coherent quantum information that can be transmitted through such a channel is called the quantum channel capacity <span class="math inline">\(Q [19,34]\)</span>. Previously, one of the most important applications of the decoupling theorem had been to show that, by using a random unitary encoding, it is possible to asymptotically transfer <span class="math inline">\(1-2 p\)</span> logical qubits per physical qubit over a lossy channel in which a fraction <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the physical qubits is lost <span class="math inline">\([19] .\)</span> In our settings, the projective measurements are distinguished from qubit loss errors since their measurement outcomes are available as classical information. This allows achieving a higher quantum channel capacity <span class="math inline">\(1-p\)</span> that we prove using a new decoupling inequality <span class="math inline">\([24] .\)</span></p><p>The connection between the quantum channel capacity and the volume-law phase can be made more precise in two different settings. In the specific setting of our <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> model, we considered the capacity within a pair of neighboring qubit blocks. Here, the quantum information we wish to protect is quantified by the entanglement entropy between the qubit blocks and the rest of the system. The random unitary circuit is equivalent to repeated encoding of the information without explicit decoding. since this encoding scheme can protect <span class="math inline">\(\sim(1-p) 2 m\)</span> logical qubits in each pair of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> -qubit blocks <span class="math inline">\([24],\)</span> we expect that our system should exhibit a stable volume-law scaling of entanglement supported by those logical qubits.</p><p>In a more general setting, we consider the entire system dynamics as a quantum channel and investigate its quantum channel capacity <span class="math inline">\(Q .\)</span> To this end, we take the input state to be entangled with an auxiliary reference such that its reduced density matrix is <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{\text {in. }}\)</span> Then, we ask how much entanglement with the reference can be recovered from the combination of the output system density matrix <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{\text {out }}\)</span> and a set of classical measurement outcomes after a long time evolution. This can be quantified by the coherent information <span class="math inline">\(I _{c}\left( N , \rho_{\text {in }}\right)[35] .\)</span> For a quantum channel <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> consisting of unitary evolution interspersed with measurements (in any positive-operator valued measures), we show that [24] <span class="math display">\[Q =\max _{\rho_{\text {in }}} I _{c}\left( N , \rho_{\text {in }}\right)=\max _{\rho_{\text {in }}}\left\langle S\left(\rho_{\text {out }}\right)\right\rangle\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle S\left(\rho_{\text {out }}\right)\right\rangle\)</span> is the von Neumann entropy of <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{\text {out }},\)</span> averaged over all possible measurement outcomes during the time evolution. We note that the first equality in Eq. (4) is not generically valid, but it holds for a class of so-called degradable quantum channels that include our cases <span class="math inline">\([19,34,35] .\)</span> Using the second equality, we establish an exact connection between quantum channel capacity and the average entropy of a system undergoing any unitary evolution interspersed by measurements. A similar connection was first suggested in a recent paper by Gullans and Huse [32] .</p><p>In Ref. <span class="math inline">\([32],\left\langle S\left(\rho_{\text {out }}\right)\right\rangle\)</span> for the maximally mixed initial state was shown to undergo a phase transition, which coincides with the entanglement phase transition for pure initial states. Specifically, in the volume-law phase, <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle S\left(\rho_{\text {out }}\right)\right\rangle\)</span> remains extensive at late time, while in the area-law phase, it rapidly approaches a value of order one. This transition was dubbed the purification phase transition [32]. The equivalence between the purification and entanglement phase transitions has later been established analytically for local Haar random unitary circuits with measurements [36]. Therefore, Eq. (4) also builds a quantitative connection between the quantum channel capacity and the entanglement phase transition. We note that, in random circuit models studied in Refs. <span class="math inline">\([15,16,32,36,37],\)</span> the channel <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> itself is random, whose average <span class="math inline">\(I _{c}\)</span> is maximized for the maximally mixed input, furthering the connection [24] .</p><p>We note that, after we conjectured the relation between the quantum channel capacity and entanglement phase transition in the earlier preprint version of this paper, Ref. [32] provided the first quantitative evidence, proving that the single-shot quantum channel capacity is upper bounded by the average entropy of the output and showed that the stabilizer circuit saturates the bound. In this new version, we further prove a generic equality between output entropy and quantum channel capacity by considering the classical information in measurement outcomes as part of the channel.</p><h2 id="补充材料">补充材料</h2><h2 id="参考文献">参考文献</h2><ul><li>《Quantum Error Correction in Scrambling Dynamics and Measurement-Induced Phase Transition》<a href="https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05124" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arxiv1903.05124</a></li></ul>]]></content>

Error correction is a central concept in classical information theory, and quantum error correction is similarly foundational in quantum information theory. Both are concerned with the fundamental problem of communication, and/or information storage, in the presence of noise. The codewords which arise in QEC are also interesting objects in their own right, displaying rich forms of entanglement.</p><p>This introduction will concentrate on the essential ideas of QEC and on the construction and use of quantum error correcting codes. The motivation is that although QEC is now quite a well established subject, it remains only vaguely understood by many people interested in quantum information and computing, or little studied by students learning it, because it appears to require mathematical knowledge they do not possess, and to be limited in application. Introductions tend to stay at the level of singleerror-correcting codes, and single-qubit encoding codes, but this is a mistake because some of the essential properties only emerge when multiple errors and encoding of multiple qubits are considered. The mathematical methods are elegant and fairly easy to acquire, they are probably essential tools for anyone wishing to think of good ways to manipulate multi-qubit systems.</p><p>An important area only briefly touched on in this tutorial is the physics of noise, and the fidelity that can be achieved via QEC methods. This is important because it underlies much of what we think can actually be achieved by quantum information processing in the future. A further important subject closely connected to QEC is that of fault-tolerant methods. They are not discussed here (for introductory discussions see [1,2,3,4])</p><p>Error correction is especially important in quantum computers, because efficient quantum algorithms make use of large scale quantum interference, which is fragile, i.e. sensitive to imprecision in the computer and to unwanted coupling between the computer and the rest of the world <span class="math inline">\([5,6,8,7] .\)</span> This makes large scale quantum computation so difficult as to be practically impossible unless error correction methods are used <span class="math inline">\([1,2,9] .\)</span> Indeed, before quantum error correction was discovered, it seemed that this fragility would forbid large scale quantum computation. The ability to correct a quantum computer efficiently without disturbing the coherence of the computation is highly non-intuitive, and was thought more or less impossible. The discovery of powerful error correction methods therefore caused much excitement, since it converted large scale quantum computation from a practical impossibility to a possibility.</p><p>The first quantum error correcting codes were discovered independently by Shor [10] and Steane <span class="math inline">\([11] .\)</span> Shor proved that 9 qubits could be used to protect a single qubit against general errors, while Steane described a general code construction whose simplest example does the same job using 7 qubits (see section 7.2 ). A general theory of quantum error correction dates from subsequent papers of Calderbank and Shor [12] and Steane [13] in which general code constructions, existence proofs, and correction methods were given. Knill and Laflamme [14] and Bennett et. al. [15] provided a more general theoretical framework, describing requirements for quantum error correcting codes (section 5.3 ), and measures of the fidelity of corrected states. They, and independently Ekert and Macchiavello [16] and Gottesman [17] derived the quantum Hamming bound (section 5.4 ). The close relationship between entanglement purification [19,18] and quantum error correction was discussed by Bennett et. al. <span class="math inline">\([15] .\)</span> They, and independently Laflamme et. al. [20] discovered the perfect 5 qubit code (section 5.2 ).</p><p>The important concept of the stabilizer (section 5.2 ) is due to Gottesman [17] and independently Calderbank et. al. [21]; this yielded many useful insights into the subject, and permitted many new codes to be discovered <span class="math inline">\([17,21,22,23,24] .\)</span> Stabilizer methods will probably make a valuable contribution to other areas in quantum information physics. The quantum MacWilliams identities were discovered by Shor and Laflamme <span class="math inline">\([25],\)</span> these provide further important constraints on codes and fidelity measures. The idea of recursively encoding and encoding again was explored by Knill and Laflamme <span class="math inline">\([26],\)</span> and Aharonov and BenOr <span class="math inline">\([27] .\)</span> This uses more quantum resources in a hierarchical way, to permit communication over arbitrarily long times or distances. Van Enk et. al. [28] have discussed quantum communication over noisy channels using a realistic model of trapped atoms and high-quality optical cavities, and recursive techniques for systems in which two-way classical communication is possible have been discussed. since these early works, quantum code constructions have been discussed by many authors, and general questions about the information capacity of noisy channels have been settled, see [29] for a review.</p><p>The organisation of the article is as follows. Section 2 is very basic, it introduces the 3 -bit code for the absolute beginner. Sections 3 and 4 cover classical coding theory, linear vector spaces and so on. They can be omitted by readers familiar with classical error correction, but are needed by those not familiar with it in order to progress beyond the most simple quantum codes later on. Sections 5 and 6 contain the main meat of the article. They introduce the basic concepts of noise and errors, the mathematics of error operators and stabilizers, and the elements of quantum error correction coding (the construction and behaviour of codes). Section 7 then goes into the code construction and the error correction process in more detail, for the benefit of students wishing to acquire as much physical insight as possible; the other sections can stand alone without it. Section 8 is very brief and incomplete but nevertheless necessary to complete the foundations: it discusses some aspects of the physics of noise which we need in order to understand to what extent QEC will be successful in practice.</p><h2 id="三比特码">2 三比特码</h2><p>We will begin by analysing in detail the workings of the most simple quantum error correcting code. Exactly what is meant by a quantum error correcting code will become apparent.</p><p>Suppose a source A wishes transmit quantum information via a noisy communication channel to a receiver B. Obviously the channel must be noisy in practice since no channel is perfectly noise-free. However, in order to do better than merely sending quantum bits down the channel, we must know something about the noise. For this introductory section, the following properties will be assumed: the noise acts on each qubit independently, and for a given qubit has an effect chosen at random between leaving the qubit's state unchanged (probability <span class="math inline">\(1-p\)</span> ) and applying a Pauli <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x}\)</span> operator (probability <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;1 / 2\)</span> ). This is a very artificial type of noise, but once we can correct it, we will find that our correction can also offer useful results for much more realistic types of noise.</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210102213917168.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><blockquote><p>Figure</p><ol type="1"><li>Simple example illustrating the principles of quantum error correction. Alice wishes to transmit a single-qubit state <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle=a|0\rangle+b|1\rangle\)</span> to Bob through a channel which introduces <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x}\)</span> errors <span class="math inline">\((|0\rangle \leftrightarrow|1\rangle)\)</span> randomly. Alice prepares two further qubits in the state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle,\)</span> represented by a small circle. She then encodes her single qubit into a joint state of three qubits, by two controlled-not operations. These three qubits are sent to Bob. At the receiving end, Bob recovers the joint state by extracting a syndrome, and correcting on the basis of this syndrome. The correction is a <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x}\)</span> operation applied to one (or none) of the qubits. Finally, a decoding operation disentangles one qubit from the others, giving Bob a single qubit in the state <span class="math inline">\(|\phi\rangle\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(1-O\left(p^{2}\right)\)</span>.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The simplest quantum error correction method is summarised in fig. 1. We adopt the convention of calling the source Alice and the receiver Bob. The state of any qubit that Alice wishes to transmit can be written without loss of generality <span class="math inline">\(a|0\rangle+b|1\rangle .\)</span> Alice prepares two further qubits in the state <span class="math inline">\(|0\rangle,\)</span> so the initial state of all three is <span class="math inline">\(a|000\rangle+b|100\rangle .\)</span> Alice now operates a controlled-not gate from the first qubit to the second, producing <span class="math inline">\(a|000\rangle+b|110\rangle,\)</span> followed by a controlled-not gate from the first qubit to the third, producing <span class="math inline">\(a|000\rangle+b|111\rangle .\)</span> Finally, Alice sends all three qubits down the channel.</p><p>Bob receives the three qubits, but they have been acted on by the noise in the channel. Their state is one of the following: state <span class="math inline">\(\quad\)</span> probability <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ll}a|000\rangle+b|111\rangle &amp; (1-p)^{3} \\a|100\rangle+b|011\rangle &amp; p(1-p)^{2} \\a|010\rangle+b|101\rangle &amp; p(1-p)^{2} \\a|001\rangle+b|110\rangle &amp; p(1-p)^{2} \\a|110\rangle+b|001\rangle &amp; p^{2}(1-p) \\a|101\rangle+b|010\rangle &amp; p^{2}(1-p) \\a|011\rangle+b|100\rangle &amp; p^{2}(1-p) \\a|111\rangle+b|000\rangle &amp; p^{3}\end{array}\]</span> Bob now introduces two more qubits of his own, prepared in the state <span class="math inline">\(|00\rangle .\)</span> This extra pair of qubits, referred to as an ancilla, is not strictly necessary, but makes error correction easier to understand and becomes necessary when fault-tolerant methods are needed. Bob uses the ancilla to gather information about the noise. He first carries out controlled-noTs from the first and second received qubits to the first ancilla qubit, then from the first and third received qubits to the second ancilla bit. The total state of all five qubits is now <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{cc}\text { state } &amp; \text { probability } \\(a|000\rangle+b|111\rangle)|00\rangle &amp; (1-p)^{3} \\(a|100\rangle+b|011\rangle)|11\rangle &amp; p(1-p)^{2} \\(a|010\rangle+b|101\rangle)|10\rangle &amp; p(1-p)^{2} \\(a|001\rangle+b|110\rangle)|01\rangle &amp; p(1-p)^{2} \\(a|110\rangle+b|001\rangle)|01\rangle &amp; p^{2}(1-p) \\(a|101\rangle+b|010\rangle)|10\rangle &amp; p^{2}(1-p) \\(a|011\rangle+b|100\rangle)|11\rangle &amp; p^{2}(1-p) \\(a|111\rangle+b|000\rangle)|00\rangle &amp; p^{3}\end{array}\]</span> Bob measures the two ancilla bits in the basis <span class="math inline">\(\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\} .\)</span> This gives him two classical bits of information. This information is called the error syndrome, since it helps to diagnose the errors in the received qubits. Bob's next action is as follows:</p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>measured syndrome</th><th>action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>00</td><td>do nothing</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>01</td><td>apply <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x}\)</span> to third qubit</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>10</td><td>apply <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x}\)</span> to second qubit</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>11</td><td>apply <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x}\)</span> to first qubit</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Suppose for example that Bob's measurements give 10 (i.e. the ancilla state is projected onto |10<span class="math inline">\()\)</span>. Examining eq. ( 2 ), we see that the state of the received qubits must be either <span class="math inline">\(a|010\rangle+b|101\rangle\)</span> (probability <span class="math inline">\(\left.p(1-p)^{2}\right)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(a|101\rangle+b|010\rangle\)</span> (probability <span class="math inline">\(\left.p^{2}(1-p)\right)\)</span>. since the former is more likely, Bob corrects the state by applying a Pauli <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x}\)</span> operator to the second qubit. He thus obtains either <span class="math inline">\(a|000\rangle+b|111\rangle\)</span> (most likely or <span class="math inline">\(a|111\rangle+b|000\rangle .\)</span> Finally, to extract the qubit which Alice sent, Bob applies controlled-nOT from the first qubit to the second and third, obtaining either <span class="math inline">\((a|0\rangle+b|1\rangle)|00\rangle\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\((a|1\rangle+b|0\rangle)|00\rangle .\)</span> Therefore Bob has either the exact qubit sent by Alice, or Alice's qubit operated on by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x} .\)</span> Bob does not know which he has, but the important point is that the method has a probability of success greater than <span class="math inline">\(1-p\)</span>. The correction is designed to succeed whenever either no or just one qubit is corrupted by the channel, which are the most likely possibilities. The failure probability is the probability that at least two qubits are corrupted by the channel, which is <span class="math inline">\(3 p^{2}(1-p)+p^{3}=3 p^{2}-2 p^{3},\)</span> i.e. less than <span class="math inline">\(p(\)</span> as long as <span class="math inline">\(p&lt;1 / 2)\)</span>. To summarise, Alice communicates a single general qubit by expressing its state as a joint state of three qubits, which are then sent to Bob. Bob first applies error correction, then extracts a single qubit state. The probability that he fails to obtain Alice's original state is <span class="math inline">\(O\left(p^{2}\right),\)</span> whereas it would have been <span class="math inline">\(O(p)\)</span> if no error correction method had been used. We will see later that with more qubits the same basic ideas lead to much more powerful noise suppression, but it is worth noting that we already have quite an impressive result: by using just three times as many qubits, we reduce the error probability by a factor <span class="math inline">\(\sim 1 / 3 p,\)</span> i.e. a factor <span class="math inline">\(\sim 30\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(p=0.01, \sim 300\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(p=0.001,\)</span> and so on.</p><h2 id="二元场和离散向量空间">3 二元场和离散向量空间</h2><p>In order to generalise the above ideas, we will need to understand the theory of classical error correcting codes, and this section provides some mathematical preliminaries.</p><p>Classical error correction is concerned with classical bits, not quantum states. The mathematical treatment is based on the fact that linear algebraic operations such as addition and multiplication can be consistently defined using finite rather than infinite sets of integers, by using modular arithmetic. The simplest case, that of modulo 2 arithmetic, will cover almost everything in this article. The addition operation is defined by <span class="math inline">\(0+0=0,0+1=1+0=1,1+1=0 .\)</span> The set {0,1} is a group under this operation, since 0 is the identity element, both elements are their own inverse and the operation is associative. The set {0,1} is also a group under multiplication, with identity element 1. Furthermore, we can also define division (except division by zero) and subtraction, and the commutative and distributive laws hold. These properties together define a finite field, also called a Galois field. Thus the set {0,1} is referred to as the field <span class="math inline">\(GF (2),\)</span> where addition and multiplication are as defined.</p><p>A string of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bits is considered to be a vector of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> components, for example 011 is the vector <span class="math inline">\((0,1,1) .\)</span> Vector addition is carried out by the standard method of adding components, for example <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}(0,1,1)+(1,0,1)&amp;=(0+1,1+0,1+1)\\&amp;=(1,1,0)\end{aligned}\]</span> It is easy to see that this operation is equivalent to the exclusive-or operation <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span> carried out bitwise between the binary strings: <span class="math inline">\(011 \oplus 101=110 .\)</span> Note that <span class="math inline">\(u+u \equiv 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u-v=u+v(\)</span> prove by adding <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to both sides <span class="math inline">\()\)</span></p><p>We can define the inner product (or scalar product) by the standard rule of multiplying corresponding components, and summing the results: <span class="math inline">\((1,1,0,1) \cdot(1,0,0,1)=1+0+0+1=0 .\)</span> Note that all the arithmatic is done by the rules of the Galois field, so the final answer is only ever 0 or <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> The inner product is also called a parity check or check sum since it indicates whether the second vector 'satisfies' the parity check specified by the first vector (or equivalently whether the first vector satisfies the parity check specified by the second). To satisfy a parity check <span class="math inline">\(u,\)</span> a vector <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> must have an even number of 1 's at the positions (coordinates) specified by the 1 's in <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> are row vectors then <span class="math inline">\(u \cdot v=u v^{T}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the transpose operation.</p><p>The number of non-zero components of a binary vector <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is important in what follows, and is called the weight (or Hamming weight), written wt <span class="math inline">\((u) .\)</span> For example, wt <span class="math inline">\((0001101)=3 .\)</span> The number of places (coordinates) where two vectors differ is called the Hamming distance between the vectors; the distance between <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(wt (u+v)\)</span></p><p>There are <span class="math inline">\(2^{n}\)</span> vectors of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> components (stated in other language, there are <span class="math inline">\(2^{n} n\)</span> -bit words). This set of vectors forms a linear vector space, sometimes called Hamming space. It is a discrete vector space since vector components are are only ever equal to 0 or <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> The vectors point to the vertices of a square lattice in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dimensions. The space is spanned by any set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> linearly independent vectors. The most obvious set which spans the space is <span class="math display">\[\{1000 \cdots 00,0100 \cdots 00,0010 \cdots 00, \ldots, 0000 \cdots 01\}\]</span> There are subspaces within Hamming space. A linear subspace <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is any set of vectors which is closed under addition, ie <span class="math inline">\(u+v \in C \forall u, v \in C .\)</span> For example the set 0000,0011,1100,1111 is a <span class="math inline">\(2^{2}\)</span> linear subspace of the <span class="math inline">\(2^{4}\)</span> Hamming space. A linear subspace containing <span class="math inline">\(2^{k}\)</span> vectors is spanned by <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> linearly independent vectors (for example 0011 and 1100 in the case just given). Any linear subspace is thus completely specified by its generator matrix <span class="math inline">\(G,\)</span> which is just the matrix whose <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> rows are any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> vectors which span the space. We can always linearly combine rows to get an equivalent generator matrix, for example <span class="math display">\[G=\left(\begin{array}{l}0011 \\1100\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{l}0011 \\1111\end{array}\right)\]</span> The minimum distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of a subspace is the smallest Hamming distance between any two members of the subspace. If the two closest vectors are <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v,\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(d=\operatorname{wt}(u+v) .\)</span> For the case of a linear space, <span class="math inline">\(w=u+v\)</span> is also a member of the space. From this we deduce that the minimum distance of a linear space is equal to the smallest weight of a non-zero member of the space. This fact is useful in calculating the value of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, since it is much easier to find the minimum weight than to evaluate all the distances in the space.</p><p>Now, if <span class="math inline">\(u \cdot v=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u \cdot w=0\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(u \cdot(v+w)=0 .\)</span> From this it follows, that if all the rows of a generator satisfy the parity check <span class="math inline">\(u,\)</span> then all so do all the vectors in the subspace. Any given parity check <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> divides Hamming space exactly in half, into those vectors which satisfy <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and those that do not. Therefore, the <span class="math inline">\(2^{k}\)</span> vectors of a linear subspace in <span class="math inline">\(2^{n}\)</span> Hamming space can satisfy at most <span class="math inline">\(n-k\)</span> linearly independent parity checks. These parity checks together form the parity check matrix <span class="math inline">\(H,\)</span> which is another way to define the linear subspace. <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> columns and <span class="math inline">\(n-k\)</span> rows. For any given subspace, the check and generator matrices are related by <span class="math display">\[H G^{T}= 0\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(G^{T}\)</span> is the transpose of <span class="math inline">\(G,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\((n-k) \times k\)</span> zero matrix. The simple error correction method described in the previous section is based around the very simple binary vector space 000,111 . Its generator matrix is <span class="math inline">\(G=(111)\)</span> and the parity check matrix is <span class="math display">\[H=\left(\begin{array}{l}110 \\101\end{array}\right)\]</span> A useful relationship enables us to derive each of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> from the other. It is always possible to convert <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> to the form <span class="math inline">\(G=\left(I_{k}, A\right)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(I_{k}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(k \times k\)</span> identity matrix, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the rest of <span class="math inline">\(G(\operatorname{so} A\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(k \times n-k)\)</span> To do the conversion we can linearly combine rows of <span class="math inline">\(G,\)</span> and if necessary swap columns of <span class="math inline">\(G .\)</span> Once we have the right form for <span class="math inline">\(G,\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> can be written down immediately, it is <span class="math inline">\(H=\left(A^{T}, I_{n-k}\right)\)</span>.</p><p>The last concept which we will need in what follows is that of the <span class="math inline">\(d u a l .\)</span> The dual space <span class="math inline">\(C^{\perp}\)</span> is the set of all vectors <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> which have zero inner product with all vectors in <span class="math inline">\(C, u \cdot v=0 \forall v \in C .\)</span> It is simple to deduce that the parity check matrix of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the generator matrix of <span class="math inline">\(C^{\perp}\)</span> and vice versa. If <span class="math inline">\(H=G\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(C=C^{\perp}\)</span>, such spaces are termed self-dual.</p><p>The notation <span class="math inline">\((n, m, d)\)</span> is a shorthand for a set of <span class="math inline">\(m n\)</span> -bit vectors having minimum distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. For linear vector spaces, the notation <span class="math inline">\([n, k, d]\)</span> is used, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is now the dimension of the vector space, so it contains <span class="math inline">\(2^{k}\)</span> vectors.</p><p>Let us conclude this section with another example of a linear binary vector space which will be important in what follows. It is a [7,4,3] space discovered by Hamming <span class="math inline">\([30] .\)</span> The generator matrix is <span class="math display">\[G=\left(\begin{array}{l}1010101 \\0110011 \\0001111 \\1110000\end{array}\right)\]</span> so the sixteen members of the space are <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{llll}0000000 &amp; 1010101 &amp; 0110011 &amp; 1100110 \\0001111 &amp; 1011010 &amp; 0111100 &amp; 1101001 \\1110000 &amp; 0100101 &amp; 1000011 &amp; 0010110 \\1111111 &amp; 0101010 &amp; 1001100 &amp; 0011001\end{array}\]</span> these have been written in the following order: first the zero vector, then the first row of <span class="math inline">\(G .\)</span> Next add the second row of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> to the two vectors so far obtained, then add the third row to the four vectors previously obtained, and so on. We can see at a glance that the minimum distance is 3 since the minimum non-zero weight is <span class="math inline">\(3 .\)</span> The parity check matrix is <span class="math display">\[H=\left(\begin{array}{l}1010101 \\0110011 \\0001111\end{array}\right)\]</span> It is simple to confirm that <span class="math inline">\(H G^{T}= 0\)</span>. Note also that since <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is made of rows of <span class="math inline">\(G,\)</span> this code contains its dual: <span class="math inline">\(C^{\perp} \in C\)</span>.</p><h2 id="经典纠错">4 经典纠错</h2><p>Classical error correction is a large subject, a full introduction may be found in many readily available textbooks <span class="math inline">\([31,32,33,34] .\)</span> In order to keep the present discussion reasonably self-contained, a minimal set of ideas is given here. These will be sufficient to guide us in the construction of quantum error correcting codes.</p><p>Classical communication can be considered without loss of generality to consist in the communication of strings of binary digits, i.e. the binary vectors introduced in the previous section. A given binary vector, also called a binary word, which we wish to send from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B,\)</span> is called a message.

The interaction generates the Kondo spin-singlet ground state; the ensuing entanglement with the conduction electrons converts the local moments into quasiparticles that can hybridize with the conduction electrons. This leads to a metal with a large, strongly renormalized effective carrier mass, which is the hallmark of the heavy fermion system classification. The resulting state could be a heavy fermion metal or a Kondo insulator depending on whether the chemical potential lies within or falls between the hybridized bands (3-5).

This model contains the strongly correlated <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> electrons and a band of conduction <span class="math inline">\(s p d\)</span> electrons, respectively. It is realistic in that it captures the inversion-symmetry breaking and spinorbital coupling in a tunable way. In the regime where the electronelectron repulsion is much larger than the width of the conductionelectron band, the interaction-induced renormalization factor can be very large. In addition, because the inversion-symmetry breaking term, spin-orbit coupling and other electronic couplings are renormalized in very different ways, it is a priori unclear whether any Weyl state can be realized in a robust way. Our work advances an affirmative answer in this well-defined microscopic model. Moreover, we demonstrate the key signatures of the WKSM phase, which turn out to be realized in several new heavy fermion compounds.</p><p>The Hamiltonian for the periodic Anderson model to be studied is <span class="math display">\[H=H_{d}+H_{c d}+H_{c}\]</span> For a proof-of-concept demonstration, we consider a cubic system in which the breaking of inversion symmetry can be readily incorporated.

Such Weyl semimetals show topological protection while conducting electricity both in the bulk and on the surface. An outstanding question is whether topological protection can happen in metals with strong correlations. Here, we report the first theoretical work on any strongly correlated lattice model to demonstrate the emergence of a Weyl-Kondo semimetal. We identify Weyl fermions in the bulk and Fermi arcs on the surface, both of which are associated with the many-body phenomenon called Kondo effect. We determine a key signature of this Weyl-Kondo semimetal, which is realized in a newly discovered heavy fermion compound.</p><h3 id="区域">区域</h3><p>We consider the regime with the <strong>onsite interaction</strong> <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> being large compared to the bare <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> -electron bandwidth <span class="math inline">\((U / t \rightarrow \infty)\)</span>.

All these imply that the nodal excitations develop out of the Kondo effect.</p><figure><img src="http://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210107211404522.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" alt="" /><figcaption>image-20210107211404522</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Fig.3 Characterization of the Weyl nodes.

Focusing on the (001) surface, we find the following energy dispersion for the surface states: <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{c} E \left(k_{x}, k_{y}\right)=-2 \sin \left(\frac{k_{x}}{4}\right) \sin \left(\frac{k_{y}}{4}\right)+\frac{V_{s}^{2}+\left(E_{s}\right)^{2}}{2 E_{s}} \\-\sqrt{\left(2 \sin \left(\frac{k_{x}}{4}\right) \sin \left(\frac{k_{y}}{4}\right)-\frac{V_{s}^{2}-\left(E_{s}\right)^{2}}{2 E_{s}}\right)^{2}+V_{s}^{2}}\end{array}\]</span> where we define the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\left(V_{s}, E_{s}, \mu_{s}\right)=\left(r V, E_{d}+\right.\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\left.\ell,-(r V)^{2} /\left(E_{d}+\ell\right)\right)\)</span>. (For the derivation, see Supplementary Information.) In Figs. <span class="math inline">\(4( a )-4( b ),\)</span> we show the energy dispersion along a high symmetry path in the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -space. The solid lines represent the surface states, and the dashed lines show where they merge with the bulk states and can no longer be sharply distinguished. The surface electron spectrum has a width that is similarly narrow as the bulk electron band (compare Fig. <span class="math inline">\(4( b )\)</span> with Fig. <span class="math inline">\(3( a ))\)</span>, implying that the surface states also come from the Kondo effect. The surface Fermi arcs (where <span class="math inline">\(E \left(k_{x}, k_{y}\right)=0\)</span> ) connect the Weyl nodes along <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}=0\)</span>, separating the positive and negative energy surface patches, marked by the solid black lines in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(4( a )\)</span></p><p>As is typical for strongly correlated systems, the most dominant interactions in heavy fermion systems are onsite, making it important to study them in lattice models (as opposed to the continuum limit). Our explicit calculations have been possible using a welldefined model on a diamond lattice that permits inversion-symmetry breaking. Nonetheless, we expect our conclusion to qualitatively apply to other noncentrosymmetric <span class="math inline">\(3 D\)</span> systems. Finally, the WKSM is expected to survive the effect of a time-reversal symmetry breaking term, such as a magnetic field; this is illustrated in the Supplementary Information.</p><p>We now turn to the implications of our results for heavy fermion semimetals. The entropy from the bulk Weyl nodes will be dictated by the velocity <span class="math inline">\(v^{*},\)</span> and the corresponding specific heat per unit volume has the following form (see Supplementary Information): <span class="math display">\[c_{v} \sim\left(k_{B} T / \hbar v^{*}\right)^{3} k_{B}\]</span> We stress that this expression is robust against the residual interactions of the nodal excitations (see Supplementary Information). The utility of thermodynamical quantities as a key signature reflects an important distinction of the WKSM from weakly correlated Weyl semimetals. The Kondo temperature of typical heavy fermion systems is considerably smaller than the Debye temperature. This is to be contrasted with the weakly correlated systems, in which the bandwidth of the conduction electrons is much larger than the Debye temperature. Therefore, in a WKSM, the nodal contributions to the entropy would dominate over the phonon component. The corresponding form of entropy also implies that the nodal excitations will have large contributions to the thermopower.</p><p>Eq.(4) can be readily tested, given that there is a considerable number of semimetallic heavy fermion compounds (4). A noncentrosymmetric heavy-fermion system <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3}\)</span> has recently been discovered to display semimetal behavior based on transport measurements, and its specific heat is well described in terms of Eq. (4) [Ref. (9)]. A fit in terms of our theoretical expression Eq. (S29) (Supplementary Information) reveals an effective velocity, <span class="math inline">\(v^{*},\)</span> that is three orders of magnitude smaller than that expected for weakly correlated systems, reflecting the reduction in the energy scale <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> the Kondo temperature for <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3}-\)</span> from the bandwidth of the latter by a similar order of magnitude (9). This analysis provides strong evidence that <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3}\)</span> is a candidate WKSM system with strongly-correlated Weyl nodes, and provides the motivation for further studies on such quantities as magnetotransport and highresolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in this system. More recently, Eq. (4) has been used to fit the specific heat of another heavy fermion system, YbPtBi, suggesting it be another candidate WKSM system (29).</p><p>Our theoretical results provide guidance in the search for Weyl semimetals in other heavy fermion systems. For instance, in the <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> -based system CeSb, Weyl physics has been suggested based on magnetotransport measurements <span class="math inline">\((30,31) .\)</span> Even though any nodes in this system are likely away from the Fermi energy, the fact that it is a Kondo system with low energy scales leads to the expectation that they can be tuned towards the Fermi energy by pressure or chemical doping, and we propose specific heat measurements and our Eq. (4) as a means of ascertaining the role of the <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> -electrons in this system. In addition, the noncentrosymmetric <span class="math inline">\(CeRu _{4} Sn _{6}\)</span> also displays semimetal properties (6) and has been discussed as a potential topological system (7) . Its electronic structure has been studied by <span class="math inline">\(a b\)</span> initio calculations combined with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) (6,32) or the Gutzwiller projection method (33). While the two types of calculations disagree on the low-energy dispersion and the latter study does not appear to capture the strong renormalizations expected in a Kondo system, the existence of linearlydispersing nodes and their Weyl nature have been suggested in the latter study. The low-temperature specific heat in single crystalline <span class="math inline">\(CeRu _{4} Sn _{6}\)</span> (34) implies the importance of the <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> -electrons to the low-energy physics but does not appear to have the form of Eq. (4). Our theoretical results suggest that further thermodynamic and thermoelectrical studies will be instructive in ascertaining the potential WKSM nature of <span class="math inline">\(CeRu _{4} Sn _{6}\)</span></p><p>We close with several observations. First, we have focused on a model defined on an nonsymmorphic diamond lattice, in which, for non-interacting electrons, the crystallographic space group symmetry allows for a filling-enforced semimetal state (21,25) . Our study here demonstrates that for Kondo systems defined on such a lattice and in the presence of inversion-symmetry breaking, the WKSM phase arises in a robust way. On the other hand, for non-interacting systems in <span class="math inline">\(3 D\)</span> a Dirac semimetal can also arise at the phase transition between topologically distinct insulating states. It will therefore be instructive to search for the WKSM state at topological phase transitions in Kondo systems; we leave this matter for future studies.</p><p>Second, our work provides a proof of principle demonstration for the emergence of a WKSM phase in a Kondo lattice with inversion symmetry breaking. This makes it likely that such a phase arises in inversion-symmetry-breaking <span class="math inline">\(3 D\)</span> Kondo lattices with other crystallographic symmetries. The candidate WKSM material <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3}\)</span> has a nonsymmorphic space group <span class="math inline">\((220),\)</span> and its Kondo-driven Weyl nodes may very well be enforced by its crystallographic symmetry and electron filling. Our findings here motivates further studies that incorporates the realistic electronic structure of <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3}\)</span>.</p><p>Third, in the WKSM state advanced here, the electron correlations produce a zeroth-order effect given that the localized moments of the <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> -electrons underlie the Weyl excitations. Correspondingly, the renormalization factors (for the nodal velocity) are extremely large, typically on the order of <span class="math inline">\(10^{2}-10^{3}\)</span>. This distinguishes the WKSM from other types of interacting Weyl semimetals discussed previously. The large renormalization factor is responsible for the possibility of using thermodynamics to probe the Weyl nodes. Our work also sets the stage for calculations of additional signature properties for the Weyl physics, such as the optical conductivity and related dynamical quantities.</p><p>Fourth, the context of heavy fermion systems links the WKSM phase advanced here with the topological Kondo insulators (5) and the physics of their surface states (35). Nonetheless, the WKSM as a state of matter is distinct: in the bulk, it features strongly renormalized Weyl nodes instead of being fully gapped; on the surface, it hosts Fermi arcs from a band with a width of the Kondo energy, which are to be contrasted with the surface Dirac nodes of the topological Kondo insulators. This also dictates that the WKSM will be realized in heavy fermion materials that are quite different from those for the topological Kondo insulators, as exemplified by the aforementioned <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3}\)</span>.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated an emergent Weyl-Kondo semimetal phase in a model of heavy fermion systems with broken inversion symmetry, and have determined the surface electronic spectra which reveal Fermi arcs. The nodal excitations of the WKSM phase develop out of the Kondo effect. This leads to unique experimental signatures for such a phase, which are realized in a noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion system. Our results are expected to guide the experimental search for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> -electron-based Weyl semimetals. In general, they open the door for studying topological semimetals in the overall context of quantum phases and their transitions in strongly correlated electron systems and, conversely, broaden the reach of strongly correlated gapless and quantum critical states of matter.</p><h2 id="模型">2 模型</h2><figure><img src="http://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210106215713974.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" alt="" /><figcaption>image-20210106215713974</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Fig. 1.

In summary, the Femi liquid analysis here demonstrates that, even when the Fermi-liquid effects (the quasiparticle weight and residual interactions of the nodal excitations) are explicitly taken into account, the leading renormalization effect to the specific heat is still for the <span class="math inline">\(T^{3}\)</span> coefficient and has the form <span class="math inline">\(\left(1 / v^{*}\right)^{3}\)</span>.</p>]]></content>

Recently, a Weyl-Kondo semimetal phase has been concurrently discovered in theoretical and experimental studies. The theoretical work was carried out in a Kondo lattice model that is time-reversal invariant but inversion-symmetry breaking. In this paper, we show in some detail how nonsymmorphic space-group symmetry and strong correlations cooperate to form Weyl nodal excitations with highly reduced velocity and pin the resulting Weyl nodes to the Fermi energy. A tilted variation of the Weyl-Kondo solution is further analyzed here, following the recent consideration of such effect in the context of understanding a large spontaneous Hall effect in <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3}\)</span> (Dzsaber <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al., arXiv:1811.02819).

From the vantage point of non-interacting topological states of matter, the typical questions of interest concern the effect of electron correlations on non-interacting topological states, such as non-interacting topological semimetals, or about the type of weakly interacting topological phases that can be produced by interaction-induced broken symmetries. <span class="math inline">\(^{22-24}\)</span> However, in the present context, the question of interest is different: What type of topological metallic states can be driven by strong correlations?

In topological semimetals, the bulk already has a gapless excitation spectrum. This is to be contrasted with topological insulators, in which the bulk excitations are fully gapped and only the surface states are gapless. Both of these topological phases must have band inversion, a reordering of conduction and valence bands which allows the topological insulator surface states to connect the conduction and valence bands. In three dimensions, a quadratic Hamiltonian can be classified into a topological equivalence class depending on its nonspatial symmetries: time-reversal symmetry (TRS), particle-hole symmetry, and chiral symmetry. This is commonly known as the tenfold way, which can be applied to topological insulators and topological semimetals, and can accommodate spatial symmetries as well. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{28}\)</span> More specifically to Weyl semimetals, these are characterized by energy levels that meet in pairs of twofold degenerate points in momentum space as a result of tuning Hamiltonian parameters. Without other symmetries in the system, this requires tuning three parameters to achieve degeneracy, but space group symmetries may protect the degeneracies. <span class="math inline">\(^{29}\)</span> In the efforts to identify topological materials, several studies have applied symmetry classification criteria to space groups <span class="math inline">\(^{30-32}\)</span> and more specifically to particular lattice realizations, <span class="math inline">\({ }^{33,34}\)</span> as well as considered the fillings at which nonsymmorphic symmetries will enforce gapless phases. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{35}\)</span></p><p>To obtain such degeneracy, a mechanism of band inversion is a necessary but insufficient ingredient. Band inversion can occur by lattice strain, scalar relativistic effects, or spin-orbit coupling <span class="math inline">\(( SOC )^{36-38}\)</span> Given the crucial role of the <span class="math inline">\(SOC ,\)</span> the search for topological materials tends to focus on systems that are based on heavy elements with large <span class="math inline">\(SOC\)</span>. Conveniently, the lanthanides and actinides where the <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> -orbital elements as well as the often-involved heavy elements (e.g., Bi) associated with heavy fermion materials provides substantial SOC.</p><p>We are interested in topological semimetals in <span class="math inline">\(3 D\)</span> crystals with <span class="math inline">\(SOC\)</span> and additional space-group symmetries that can protect nodal band crossings. It turns out that many nonsymmorphic space groups can support four-dimensional irreducible representations on the zone boundaries, which produce robust symmetry protected Dirac semimetal phases, provided they do not lie along threefold or sixfold rotation axes. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{29,39}\)</span> A nonsymmorphic symmetry is a space group operation <span class="math inline">\(\{ O \mid t \}\)</span> which combines a spatial point-group operation (or nonspatial operation) <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> with a partial (non-primitive) lattice translation vector <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Spatial symmetries are group operations that rotate and reflect different lattice sites onto one another, such as an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> -fold rotation about the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> th axis <span class="math inline">\(C_{n i},\)</span> or a reflection about the <span class="math inline">\(a b\)</span> plane with normal vector <span class="math inline">\(\hat{c}, m_{c} .\)</span> Respectively, the corresponding nonsymmorphic transformations are called screw operations <span class="math inline">\(\left(\left\{C_{n i} \mid t \right\}=\right.\)</span> rotation <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> fractional <span class="math inline">\(\left. t \right)\)</span> and glide operations <span class="math inline">\(\left(\left\{m_{c} \mid t \right\}=\right.\)</span> reflection <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> fractional <span class="math inline">\(\left. t \right) .\)</span> since multiple fractional translations are needed to traverse the unit cell, it is enlarged in real space, which causes the Brillouin zone <span class="math inline">\(( BZ )\)</span> to fold. This creates a new Brillouin zone boundary (BZB) where any bands that intersect it are sharply reflected back into the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span>, causing a degeneracy at the <span class="math inline">\(BZB\)</span>. For these reasons, nonsymmorphic space groups with SOC generically produce Dirac nodal band touching points or lines of degeneracy. The glide symmetry is familiar to the strongly correlated electron community of iron pnictides; there, the symmetry implies that the eigenstates come in (glide even and odd) pairs and, as a result, gives rise to an extra degeneracy at the boundary of the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span> associated with the physical two-iron unit cell. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{40}\)</span></p><p>With the nonsymmorphic symmetry-enforced Dirac semimetal as a starting point, a Weyl semimetal phase can arise from breaking TRS or inversion symmetry (IS). <span class="math inline">\({ }^{29}\)</span> Without the protection of space-group symmetry, one would have to resort to IS breaking (ISB) systems tuned to within a band inversion transition between a trivial band insulator and a topological insulator. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{31,41}\)</span> Bands that invert are allowed to cross because (1) the bands have different irreducible representations, such as the odd-even parity in <span class="math inline">\(s-f\)</span> coupling; (2) bands of the same irreducible representation may have 28,42 Otherwise wavefunctions that differ by a Berry phase. the noncrossing theorem requires that the bands hybridize to open a topologically trivial gap at a generic point in the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span>.</p><p>Thus a robust procedure is to search for space groups that anchor IS breaking or are also noncentrosymmetric, and can realize an even filling factor that is both gapless and has zero enclosed Fermi surface volume.</p><h4 id="b强关联性驱动的拓扑状态">B强关联性驱动的拓扑状态</h4><p>Given all these considerations, a topological state driven by the Kondo effect arises if one first realizes a topologically trivial ground state without the Kondo effect, and when the Kondo effect is turned on, produces a topologically nontrivial phase. Our model has a solution that corresponds to such a Kondo-driven phase. We will show that the result is robust to changes in parameters. This is because our Hamiltonian has the required crystal and local symmetries, and fulfills group-theoretical filling constraints that achieve topological semimetal phases in response to the Kondo effect. Therefore, our model illustrates that strong correlations help hone in on nontrivial topological phases in the vast multidimensional parameter space of the strong correlation global phase diagram in the presence of a large <span class="math inline">\(SOC\)</span>. In this sense, a design principle follows from our work (as well as from experiments <span class="math inline">\({ }^{26,27}\)</span> ), namely to search for topological semimetals driven by strong correlations by focusing on strongly correlated semimetals with a nonsymmorphic space group and broken inversion symmetry.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we first explain our model and solution method. In Sec. III, we show how the model obtains a correlations-driven topological phase transition from specific symmetry considerations (Sec. III A) and the pinning of the nodes to the Fermi energy driven by the combined effect of the space-group symmetry and strong correlations (Sec. III B). A symmetryallowed tilt term is added in the model and its role is analyzed in some detail in Sec. IV. Then in Sec. V, we discuss strong correlations-suited transport and thermodynamic signatures of WKSM phases. Finally, we close in Sec. VI by discussing heavy fermion materials as a platform for exploring topological phases, and consider the nature of topological phase transitions in the global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals.</p><h2 id="模型">2模型</h2><p>An Anderson lattice type model which describes the heavy fermion systems. <span class="math display">\[H = H _{c}+ H _{c d}+ H _{d}\]</span> The Hamiltonian separated into</p><ul><li>the part representing physical conduction <span class="math inline">\(s p d\)</span> electrons <span class="math inline">\(H _{c},\)</span></li><li>a hybridization term <span class="math inline">\(H _{c d}\)</span> which allows the formation of heavy yet mobile quasi-particles,</li><li>a part representing the physical highly localized <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> electrons <span class="math inline">\(H _{d}\)</span>.</li></ul><h4 id="传导电子">传导电子</h4><p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}H _{c} &amp;=t \sum_{\langle i j\rangle, \sigma}\left(c_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{j \sigma}+ H.c. \right) \\&amp;-\mu \sum_{i, \sigma} n_{i \sigma}^{c} \\&amp;+i \lambda \sum_{\langle\langle i j\rangle\rangle}\left[c_{i \sigma}^{\dagger}\left( \sigma \cdot e _{i j}\right) c_{j \sigma}- H.c. \right] \\&amp;+m \sum_{i, \sigma}(-1)^{i} c_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{i \sigma}\end{aligned}\]</span></p><p>This Hamiltonian is based on the Fu-Kane-Mele model. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{41,43,44}\)</span></p><ul><li>The nearest-neighbor <span class="math inline">\((\langle i j\rangle)\)</span> hopping amplitude sets the energy scale at <span class="math inline">\(t=1 ;\)</span></li><li>the chemical potential parametrizes the electron density as <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and breaks particle-hole symmetry;</li><li>the second-nearest neighbor <span class="math inline">\((\langle\langle i j\rangle\rangle)\)</span> Dresselhaus-type spin orbit coupling has strength <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and acts upon spin space in the Pauli matrix basis, in vector form <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>;</li><li>finally a sublattice-dependent atomic potential difference is tuned by <span class="math inline">\(m .\)</span> In this last term, <span class="math inline">\(m&gt;0\)</span> tunes the degree of crystal inversion symmetry breaking, serving to lift the degeneracies between the two facecentered-cubic (fec) sublattices of the diamond lattice.</li></ul><h4 id="局域电子与耦合电子">局域电子与耦合电子</h4><p>The term that allows the two species to hybridize is simply <span class="math display">\[H _{c d}=V \sum_{i, \sigma}\left(d_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{i \sigma}+ H.c. \right)\]</span> which has strength <span class="math inline">\(V,\)</span> and in the strong coupling limit that we consider, tracks the strength of the Kondo effect.</p><p>To represent the localized <span class="math inline">\(4 f\)</span> electrons, the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> -operator Hamiltonian is <span class="math display">\[H _{d}=E_{d} \sum_{i, \sigma} d_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} d_{i \sigma}+U \sum_{i} n_{i \uparrow}^{d} n_{i \downarrow}^{d}\]</span> where</p><ul><li>The first term has a flat bare atomic energy level <span class="math inline">\(E_{d}\)</span> which lies far below the conduction electron bands.</li><li>The second term is the Coulomb interaction with repulsion energy <span class="math inline">\(U,\)</span> which penalizes the double occupation of a site.</li></ul><h4 id="四分之一填充">四分之一填充</h4><p>Finally, we will primarily focus on the case of quarter filling, which corresponds to total electron count of 1 per site: <span class="math display">\[n_{d}+n_{c}=1\]</span> where, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}n_{d} &amp;=\frac{1}{N_{\text {site }}} \sum_{i, \sigma} d_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} d_{i \sigma} \\n_{c} &amp;=\frac{1}{N_{\text {site }}} \sum_{i, \sigma} c_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{i \sigma}\end{aligned}\]</span> with</p><ul><li><span class="math inline">\(N_{\text {site }}\)</span> counting the total number of sites in the lattice.</li><li>The interaction <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> term is, of course, an obstruction to obtaining the eigenstates.</li></ul><p>However, in the strong coupling limit of <span class="math inline">\(U \rightarrow \infty,\)</span> one can use the <strong>auxiliary boson</strong> method <span class="math inline">\(^{4}\)</span> to treat the Coulomb term by considering it's large limit consequence, which is to only allow density configurations of single particle-per-site occupation and empty occupancy.

However, because the Kondo-driven Weyl nodes are pinned at the Fermi energy, the strongly renormalized nodal excitations will be long-lived, with the lifetime reaching infinity when the node is approached. This makes the Kondo-driven Weyl nodal excitations well defined even though it is a strongly interacting many-body system.</p><h2 id="倾斜式外尔近藤半金属">4倾斜式外尔近藤半金属</h2><p>In the process of understanding a large spontaneous Hall effect observed in <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3},^{27}\)</span> a tilted variation of the WeylKondo solution was introduced there.

The Berry phase is the condensed matter manifestation of the geometric phase acquired when a wave system explores the landscape of its parameter space as a result of a cyclic adiabatic process. In condensed matter systems, a particle in state <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> acquires a Berry phase <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{n}\)</span> as the Hamiltonian parameters are varied around a closed path <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> without eigenstate transitions away from <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (i.e., adiabaticity is preserved). The Berry phase and the related Berry flux quantity is expressed in terms of the Berry vector potential <span class="math inline">\(A _{n}( k )\)</span> and corresponding Berry curvature <span class="math inline">\(\Omega _{n}( k )\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\Phi_{n}( S ) &amp;=\oint_{ S } d k \cdot A _{n}( k ) \\&amp;=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{\partial S } d S \cdot \Omega _{n}( k ) \\&amp;=\frac{1}{4 \pi} \int \frac{d^{3} k}{(2 \pi)^{3}} \nabla_{ k } \cdot \Omega _{n}( k )\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\Omega _{n}( k ) &amp;=\nabla_{ k } \times A _{n}( k ) \\&amp;=\left(\Omega_{n}^{y z}( k ), \Omega_{n}^{z x}( k ), \Omega_{n}^{x y}( k )\right) \\\Omega_{n}^{a b}( k ) &amp;=\sum_{n \neq n^{\prime}} \operatorname{Im} \frac{\left\langle n k \left|\partial_{k_{a}} H_{ k }\right| n^{\prime} k \right\rangle\left\langle n^{\prime} k \left|\partial_{k_{b}} H_{ k }\right| n k \right\rangle}{\left( E _{n}- E _{n^{\prime}}\right)^{2}}\end{aligned}\]</span> One immediately sees that at a Weyl node degeneracy, the denominator of Eq. (21) is zero, causing a singularity in the Berry curvature field in the momentum space [Eq. (20)]. Due to their singular structure, the positive and negative Berry curvature singularities corresponding to Weyl nodes and antinodes possess a local topological invariant that can distinguish between nodal signs, and is just the Berry flux of Eq. (18) computed around a single node. For a single Weyl node, the Berry flux density is <span class="math inline">\(\nabla \cdot \Omega =\pm 4 \pi \delta^{3}( k )\)</span> and the Berry flux is <span class="math display">\[\Phi( S )=\pm \frac{1}{4 \pi} \int \frac{d^{3} k}{(2 \pi)^{3}} 4 \pi \delta^{3}( k )=\pm 1\]</span> This tells us that the Berry flux is a quantized number that counts the number and sign of Berry charges (monopoles) in a given system. This is the reason for the "monopole" terminology: the Berry flux acts like the total charge of the Weyl point, and their associated Berry curvature (magnetic) field has a monopole or anti-monopole configuration. When the Weyl (anti-)nodes are pinned to the immediate vicinity of the Fermi energy, as happens in our Weyl-Kondo semimetal solution, the monopoles and associated Berry curvature singularities appear very close to the Fermi surface. In other words, the Fermi surface comprises tiny Fermi pockets that surround the Weyl (anti)nodes, and states on the Fermi surface have a very large Berry curvature.</p><p>An intriguing question is how to tune the singular nature of the Berry curvature. Tilting the Weyl cone dispersion is one means of doing so. An example of the tilt behavior of the model is seen in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(7 .\)</span> The color scale indicates the magnitude of the <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{y z}\)</span> component of the Berry curvature, which is highly concentrated around the node and discontinuous at the node, located in the center of each plot. The solid and dashed contours show the Fermi surface produced with <span class="math inline">\(C=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C=0.9,\)</span> respectively, from a slightly metallic filling <span class="math inline">\(n_{d}+n_{c}=1+10^{-5} .\)</span> For both cases, but especially for the tilted case, the Berry curvature is very large on the Fermi surface, reflecting the proximity of the Fermi surface to a Weyl monopole.</p><p>In Fig. <span class="math inline">\(7( a ),\)</span> the area in the momentum space shown corresponds to the small square surrounding the right red node of Fig. <span class="math inline">\(6(\)</span> a). This conveys how tiny the Fermi surfaces are compared to the extent of the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span>. In Fig. <span class="math inline">\(7( b )\)</span>, we zoom in further from Fig. 7 (a) to the vicinity of the node. Here, it is apparent that the <span class="math inline">\(C=0.9\)</span> tilted Fermi surface (dashed line) still encloses the node, but it is much closer to the node as compared to the <span class="math inline">\(C=0\)</span> Fermi surface (solid line). The tilting term is seen to make the Fermi pocket and the associated Berry curvature be distributed around the Weyl node in a highly asymmetrical way, in which highly singular Berry curvature fields strongly influence the heavy Weyl quasiparticles pinned at the Fermi surface.</p><p>In particular, Figs. <span class="math inline">\(7( a )\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(7( b )\)</span> illustrate that the asymmetry induced by the tilting term has made one side of the Fermi pocket to be much closer to the node than the other. This makes an external electric field to be readily able to drive the system to a highly out-of-equilibrium response in the Berry-curvature-induced transverse conductance, a theoretical framework that was advanced for the spontaneous Hall effect in Ref. <span class="math inline">\(27 .\)</span> As such, our result concretely demonstrates the ready realization of the giant spontaneous Hall effect put forward there.</p><h2 id="相关的拓扑结构半金属的标志">5 相关的拓扑结构半金属的标志</h2><p>Some of the conventional signatures of Weyl semimetals are quantum oscillation experiments, negative longitudinal magnetoresistance indicative of the chiral anomaly, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) imaging of both the bulk and surface states, which probes the linear nodal dispersion in the bulk and verifies topology due to the bulk-boundary-correspondence.

The WKSM phase exhibits node pinning that is contingent on the development of the Kondo effect, a slow effective Weyl fermion velocity, and, correspondingly, a narrowed bandwidth. In Refs. 25 and 26 , it was shown that the specific heat has the following form: <span class="math display">\[C_{p}=\Gamma T^{3}\]</span> The prefactor of the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -cubic dependence from the contribution of each node is <span class="math display">\[\Gamma=\frac{7 \pi^{2}}{30} k_{B}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{\hbar v^{*}}\right)^{3}\]</span> This means that <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is enhanced relative to the typical noninteracting value by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(\left(v / v^{*}\right)^{3},\)</span> the ratio of the typical Fermi velocity of a non-interacting electron band to the renormalized velocity of the Kondo-driven Weyl nodal excitations; this enhancement is robust against the residual interactions between the Weyl fermions.

This provides a means of using the Berry-curvatureinduced anomalous velocity to probe the topological characteristics of the Kondo-driven Weyl nodes in the WKSM (that is time-reversal invariant in equilibrium), at zero magnetic field and in a nonlinear response to an applied electric field, as has recently been demonstrated in Ref. <span class="math inline">\(27 .\)</span></p><h2 id="结论和展望">6 结论和展望</h2><p>We have expanded on several theoretical aspects of the Weyl-Kondo semimetal state in a noncentrosymmetric Kondo/Anderson lattice model with both strong correlations and large spin-orbit coupling. This state was advanced concurrently in theoretical <span class="math inline">\(^{25}\)</span> and experimental <span class="math inline">\(^{26,27}\)</span> studies. It preserves the time-reversal invariance. The Weyl nodes are driven by the Kondo effect and, thus, must appear within the narrow energy range near the Fermi energy for the Kondo resonance; at the same time, their existence can be traced to the degeneracy of electronic states enforced by nonsymmorphic space-group symmetry. These two features combine to pin the Weyl nodes to the immediate vicinity of the Fermi energy. Moreover, the Kondo-driven nature makes the linearlydispersing Weyl nodal excitations to have an energy scale <span class="math inline">\(k_{B} T_{K},\)</span> which is smaller than the bare conduction-electron bandwidth <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> by orders of magnitude (c.f. Fig. 4). Correspondingly, the velocity <span class="math inline">\(v^{*}\)</span> is reduced from typical values of noninteracting electrons by several orders of magnitude. An immediate consequence of such a reduced velocity is that the specific heat <span class="math inline">\(c_{V}=\Gamma T^{3},\)</span> with the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -cubic prefactor <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> enhanced from the typical non-interacting value by a huge factor of <span class="math inline">\(\left(v / v^{*}\right)^{3}\)</span>. The pinning of the Weyl nodes to the immediate vicinity of the Fermi energy also implies that the Berry curvature singularities of the Weyl nodes appear near the Fermi energy. This gives rise to a large anomalous velocity for the states on a small Fermi surface pocket surrounding the Weyl nodes. As such, this pinning of the Berry curvature singularities near the Fermi energy presents a means of probing topological characteristics of Weyl nodal excitations through a spontaneous Hall effect, which is a nonlinear response to an applied electric field, even though the system under equilibrium preserves time-reversal symmetry.</p><p>The experimental developments have taken place in the Kondo-driven semimetal <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3},\)</span> a cubic system for which the space group is nonsymmorphic (no. 220 ), the inversion symmetry is broken, but the time-reversal symmetry is preserved. <span class="math inline">\(^{27}\)</span> This new heavy fermion semimetal shows a <span class="math inline">\(T^{3}\)</span> specific heat with a huge prefactor <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma,\)</span> so much so that it surpasses the phonon contribution, <span class="math inline">\({ }^{26}\)</span> and a giant spontaneous (zero magnetic field) Hall effect and an accompanying evenin-magnetic-field component. <span class="math inline">\(^{27}\)</span> The results provide direct evidence for ultraslow Weyl nodal excitations and its topological nature.</p><p>We close with a look into future directions. First, the developments along this direction point to the search for further Weyl-Kondo semimetals in heavy fermion systems with nonsymmorphic space groups, as already exemplified by the case of <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3} .^{26,27,47}\)</span> Because the majority of the 230 space groups in three dimensions are nonsymmorphic, this suggests the prevalence of Weyl-Kondo semimetal phases in such systems. Of potential interest in this context include nonsymmorphic heavy fermion semimetals with broken inversion symmetry such as <span class="math inline">\(CeRu _{4} Sn _{6}{ }^{48-52}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(CeNiSn ,{ }^{53-55}\)</span> and those that are inversion symmetric but with time-reversal symmetry broken by an external magnetic field or magnetic ordering, such as <span class="math inline">\(YbBiPt ^{56-59}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(CeSbTe _{60-62}\)</span></p><p>Second, we have stressed that the Weyl-Kondo semimetal solution is robust because of the cooperation of the Kondo effect with the space-group symmetry. It will be instructive to explore the role of space-group symmetry on Kondo-driven bulk nodal excitations near the Fermi energy in related models. <span class="math inline">\(^{63-69}\)</span></p><p>Third, the considerations of symmetry open up different ways to think of accessing nearby topological phases, by reducing or restoring point-group or space-group symmetries. One path that has been explored is anisotropically tuning the hopping amplitudes <span class="math inline">\(t_{i j}\)</span> of the lattice bonds. <span class="math inline">\(^{41,43}\)</span> Such a symmetry-reducing tuning could be approximated through uniaxial stress, which, in Kondo systems, also tunes the strength of the Kondo effect. Another avenue is to explore nonspatial symmetries, such as time-reversal symmetry breaking. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{47}\)</span> In a one fermion flavor model, <span class="math inline">\({ }^{70}\)</span> we have established that a tunable TRSB term can coexist with the Weyl semimetal phase described in Sec. III A, but that when the TRSB term is larger than the ISB term, a topologically distinct Weyl semimetal phase can emerge with nodes in the Brillouin zone interior. It is an exciting next step to incorporate TRSB to the full Kondo-driven model. Finally, doping studies represent a promising way of tuning. <span class="math inline">\(^{26,71}\)</span></p><p>Fourth, the theoretical and experimental results on the Weyl-Kondo semimetal sets the stage to address how the overall quantum phase diagram of heavy fermion metals, Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1( b )\)</span>, is enriched by topologically nontrivial metallic phases driven by the combined effects of strong correlations and spin-orbit coupling. A recurring theme of heavy fermion metals is that novel phases develop in the quantum critical regime, at the border of electronic orders. This reflects the accumulation of entropy in the quantum critical regime, <span class="math inline">\({ }^{72-75}\)</span> as a result of which the electronic matter is soft and prone to developing novel phases. A canonical example of such emergent phases is unconventional superconductivity, 7,76 but it could also be nematic or other forms of secondary electronic orders. <span class="math inline">\(^{77}\)</span> An intriguing possibility is that, when the spin-orbit coupling and correlations are both strong, topologically nontrivial metallic states appear as emergent phases at the border of electronic order, albeit on the nonordered [ i.e., disordered; cf. Fig. $1( a )]$ side.</p><p>Finally, the approach taken here represents a general means of treating the space-group symmetry enforcement of topological semimetals in strongly correlated settings. In the theoretical model, the Weyl nodes of the bare conduction electrons enforced by the space group symmetry are located far away from the Fermi energy. When the Kondo effect takes place, the Weyl nodes are transmitted to those of the Kondodriven quasiparticles. The combination of strong correlations and space-group symmetry enforcement pins the Kondodriven Weyl nodes to the immediate vicinity of the Fermi energy. This makes the strongly correlated Weyl-nodal excitations to be well-defined, even for a underlying many-body system that is strongly interacting. Equally important, it allows the theory to connect with the striking experiments in <span class="math inline">\(Ce _{3} Bi _{4} Pd _{3} .26,27,47\)</span> This type of interplay between the spacegroup symmetry constraint and strong correlations is likely to be important in other settings of strongly correlated topological matter as well.</p><h2 id="附录">附录</h2><p>A</p><p>Here we show that in our model, the eigenenergies have Weyl nodes at the Fermi energy.

Since all parameters and eigenenergies are real, and each term in the summation within each square root is squared (nonnegative), the square root quantities are also nonnegative [Eqs.

Therefore, the solutions to <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{\pm D}=0\)</span> will be realized for nonzero <span class="math inline">\(m, \lambda\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{(m \pm \lambda D( k ))^{2}}=0\)</span> also, since the <span class="math inline">\(|m \pm D( k )|\)</span> term determines the gap in the <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{\pm D}\)</span> expressions. Along an <span class="math inline">\(X-W\)</span> line such as <span class="math inline">\(k _{X W}=\left( k _{x}, 0,2 \pi\right)\)</span>, we already know from Eq. (A10) that <span class="math inline">\(|m+\lambda D( k )|\)</span> is bounded below by <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> which we insist is nonzero. Thus we can eliminate the <span class="math inline">\(|+D\rangle\)</span> sector from consideration for the solution, and ask whether the <span class="math inline">\(|-D\rangle\)</span> sector has a solution. Along <span class="math inline">\(k _{X W}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\varepsilon_{-D}\left( k _{X W}\right) &amp;=\sqrt{\left(m-\lambda D\left( k _{X W}\right)\right)^{2}} \\&amp;=|m-4 \lambda| \sin \left(\frac{k_{x}}{2}\right)||=0 \\&amp; \leftrightarrow\left|\sin \left(\frac{k_{x}}{2}\right)\right|=\frac{m}{4 \lambda}\end{aligned}\]</span> so the Weyl nodes occur at <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}k _{W} &amp;=\left(k_{0}, 0,2 \pi\right) \\k_{0} &amp;=2 \arcsin \left(\frac{m}{4 \lambda}\right), \quad \bmod \pi\end{aligned}\]</span> where the modulo <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> node is the opposite chirality partner in the neighboring <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span>; within the first <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span>, there are six inequivalent pairs total. Therefore we conclude that Weyl-Kondo nodes develop only for bands in the <span class="math inline">\(|-D\rangle\)</span> sector.</p><p>Now it is pertinent to apply these results to the full eigenenergy expression of Eq. (A1). Since the sign of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> picks out whether the band is in the upper four or lower four, we consider <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=-1\)</span> to analyze quarter filling. Having shown that a Weyl node is permitted for the <span class="math inline">\(|-D\rangle\)</span> sector, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> must be opposite in sign for each band.</p><p>Therefore, the Weyl nodes should exist between the bands <span class="math inline">\(E _{-D}^{(-,-)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E _{-D}^{(+,-)} .\)</span> To gain some more insight, we solve <span class="math inline">\(E _{-D}^{(-,-)}\left( k _{W}\right)=0,\)</span> and express <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> in terms of other parameters. From Eq. (A1), we get <span class="math display">\[E_{s}-\mu-\sqrt{\left(E_{s}+\mu\right)^{2}+4 V_{s}^{2}}=0\]</span> which implies <span class="math display">\[-E_{s} \mu=V_{s}^{2}\]</span> Therefore, <span class="math display">\[\mu=-\frac{(r V)^{2}}{E_{d}+\ell}\]</span> so we find that the sign of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> depends on the sign of <span class="math inline">\(\left(E_{d}+\ell\right)\)</span>. In our numerical calculations for the Kondo regime at quarter filling, the solutions always follow <span class="math inline">\(\left(E_{d}+\ell\right)&gt;0\)</span>; for a given <span class="math inline">\(E_{d}&lt;0,\)</span> we find <span class="math inline">\(\ell&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left|E_{d}\right|&lt;\ell .\)</span> For example, in our parameter choice for Figs. <span class="math inline">\(4-5,\)</span> we had <span class="math inline">\(E_{d}=-7\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ell=7.279,\)</span> and such results are consistent for other values of <span class="math inline">\(E_{d}, V:\left(E_{d}+\ell\right)&gt;0 .\)</span> Thus <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is negative. We reiterate that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> can be determined analytically if the filling is integer.</p><h3 id="b-鞍点方程解法">B 鞍点方程解法</h3><p>Here we comment on the self-consistency procedure used to obtain the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\mu, r, \ell\)</span> in Ref. 25 and this work. Since the WKSM system was separable into pseudospin sectors, the Bloch Hamiltonian matrix was decomposed from one <span class="math inline">\(8 \times 8\)</span> to two <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> matrices. A matrix size of <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> yields a characteristic equation with an eigenvalue polynomial degree of four, which is the upper limit to an exactly solvable eigenvalue problem. When the calculation is exactly at quarter filling, the chemical potential does not have to be numerically determined, as shown in Appendix A.

Under certain conditions, such as interaction with a macroscopic classical object, a quantum mechanical system can rapidly <strong>evolve into an eigenstate</strong> of a specific operator, such that the resulting time evolution appears to be a non-unitary projection. Such a process is referred to as a <strong>projective measurement</strong>. When the system is projected into an eigenstate of a local operator, the corresponding local degree of freedom is disentangled from the rest of the system, resulting in a decrease in overall entanglement. In this way, projective measurements can remove some of the entanglement created by more generic unitary time evolution.</p><figure><img src="http://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210105194507551.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" alt="" /><figcaption>image-20210105194507551</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>FIG.1 Unitary-projective time evolution can be modeled via a quantum circuit consisting of alternating layers of unitary and projective operators acting on a set of local degrees of freedom.

This makes intuitive sense, in that long-range entanglement is being constantly removed from the system by projective measurements, while the entanglement resulting from local unitary evolution is only being created on short scales. We can directly calculate the typical entanglement entropy of the system. For example, consider a one-dimensional system, which we partition into two half-lines.

Within this representation, a tensor product state corresponds to a uniform density of particles, since each site is the left and right endpoint of a local (on-site) stabilizer. <strong>Entanglement is then represented as a deviation from this uniform density</strong> (纠缠被表示为对这个均匀密度的偏离).

We now wish to also account for the effects of projective measurements. When a site is measured, it becomes disentangled with the rest of the system, such that there is no difference in entanglement between the partitions to the immediate left and right of that site. In other words, measurement sets the value of <span class="math inline">\(\partial_{x} S\)</span> to zero on that site.

In App. A, we prove that the relevant diagrams are the minimal-length DW diagrams whose DW passes through the space-time point <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_{ P }\)</span> (Fig. 7 left), because this segment of DW does not give rise to a factor of <span class="math inline">\(q^{-1}\)</span> (i.e. this DW segment is "free"), which makes this diagram more dominant in the <span class="math inline">\(1 / q\)</span> -perturbative series.

An expression for the multiplicity of such leading order DW diagrams can be written in terms of a transfer matrix (acting on a Hilbert space labelled by the DW position) as described in App. B.</p><p>At a time sufficiently large, the minimal-length DW diagrams are the ones with DW ending on the side of the diagrams. Without measurements, there are two leading diagrams where the DW-s are solely directed to the left or the right (Fig 6 right). With measurements, minimal-length DW diagrams are the ones with DW passing through a certain number of projection operators to reach the side of the diagrams. We prove in App. A the following equation. <span class="math display">\[\lim _{q \rightarrow \infty}\left\langle q^{(1-\alpha) S_{\alpha}(t)}\right\rangle=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\beta q^{(1-\alpha)(t-t / / p)} &amp; t \leq p s \\\left.\gamma q^{(1-\alpha)[(p-1)(s-1)+t}(\bmod p)\right] &amp; t&gt;p s\end{array}\right.\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s=\operatorname{ceil}(1 / 2 f),\)</span> ceil <span class="math inline">\((\cdot)\)</span> is the ceiling function, and where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> are independent of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and dependent of L.

The area-law saturation originates from the fact that the DW in these leading staircase diagrams pass through <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> free DW segments. Take <span class="math inline">\(f=1 / 4\)</span> as an example, there exists a realization of projection measurements such that the DW can reach the side using 2 measurement layers each of which provides <span class="math inline">\(L / 4\)</span> "free" DW segments (Fig. 8 right). So the orders of such diagrams are at least <span class="math inline">\(q^{-2(p-1)}\)</span>.

We call a staircase diagram with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> number of staircases a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -staircase diagrams. The <span class="math inline">\(1 / q\)</span> -perturbative series of <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle q^{-S_{2}(t)}\right\rangle\)</span> can be written in terms of the contribution of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -staircase diagrams (Fig. 10 top) as <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l}\left\langle q^{-S_{2}(t)}\right\rangle \sim f^{L} \sum_{k=1}^{L} c_{k}\left[q^{-(p-1)}\right]^{k}+\ldots \\\sim \exp \left[L\left(\log f+q^{-(p-1)}\right)\right]\left[q^{-(p-1)}\right]+\ldots\end{array}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c_{k}=\int_{0}^{L} d l_{1} \int_{0}^{l_{1}} d l_{2} \cdots \int_{0}^{l_{k-2}} d l_{k-1}=L^{k-1} /(k-1) !\)</span> is the multiplicity of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -staircase diagram. As an example, the multiplicity of a 2 -staircase diagram is of order <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> because while the first staircase (counting from the top) always begin in the top center of the digram, the second staircase can begin anywhere between the center and the far right of the diagram (Fig. 10 top middle). The dots denote all other contributions to <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle q^{-S_{2}(t)}\right\rangle .\)</span> For general <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \geq 2\)</span>, the above equation becomes <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle q^{(1-\alpha) S_{\alpha}(t)}\right\rangle\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\sim \exp \left[L\left(\log f+q^{(1-\alpha)(p-1)}\right)\right]\left[q^{(1-\alpha)(p-1)}\right]+\ldots\)</span> For this contribution to not be suppressed in <span class="math inline">\(L,\)</span> we must have the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> -dependent exponent to be greater than zero, <span class="math display">\[f \gtrsim e^{-q^{(1-\alpha)(p-1)}}\]</span></p><p><span class="math display">\[f \gtrsim e^{-q^{(1-\alpha)(p-1)}}\]</span> This contribution implies it is plausible that the area-law saturation of <span class="math inline">\(S_{\alpha}\)</span> survive at least for large enough <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Note that this argument is not completely rigorous, because we have not systematically looked at all sub-leading terms in the <span class="math inline">\(1 / q\)</span> -perturbative series of <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle q^{(1-\alpha) S_{\alpha}(t)}\right\rangle .\)</span> In particular, there can in principle be diagrams that are algebraically translated in negative terms which lead to cancellation with other positive terms (these are called "non-Gaussian" diagrams in Ref. 8). To summarise, we have found an exponential numbers of staircase diagrams and argued that it is plausible for an area-law saturation of <span class="math inline">\(S_{\alpha}\)</span> to survive at least for large enough <span class="math inline">\(f,\)</span> even when the limit <span class="math inline">\(L \rightarrow \infty\)</span> is taken before the limit of large <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p><h2 id="体积定律相的限制">体积定律相的限制</h2><p>In this section, we present general arguments which highly constrain the form of von Neumann entanglement entropy in systems time-evolving via local unitaries and projectors, assuming a local Hilbert space of finite dimension. We find that a volume law entanglement entropy is not stable in the presence of measurements unless there is a subleading correction, which should serve as an important signature of measurement physics within the volume law phase. Insofar as Von Neumann entropy upper bounds Renyi entropies of higher index (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(S_{2}\)</span> ), this argument also provides upper bounds on the scaling of higher Renyi entropies. Throughout this section, 'entropy' refers to Von Neumann entropy, unless specified otherwise.</p><p>We consider a situation where, in alternating time steps, either nearest-neighbor unitaries or projective measurements are applied to each site with probability The basic observation is that for any region <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> the rate of entropy increase is only proportional to the size of the boundary <span class="math inline">\(|\partial A|,\)</span> while the rate of entropy decrease on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> due to measurement can generically be proportional to the total entropy of <span class="math inline">\(A .\)</span> The only way for these rates to balance would be for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to satisfy an area law. In contrast, a stable volume law phase requires a state in which measurements are much less effective at removing entanglement. We show that this requirement implies the existence of a subleading term in the entanglement entropy.</p><h3 id="a.-constraining-strong-volume-laws">A. Constraining strong volume laws</h3><p>In this subsection, we exclude the possibility of volume law von Neumann entropy without a subleading correction. First, we show that any bipartite unitary acting on <span class="math inline">\(D \times D\)</span> dimensions can increase the entanglement entropy between the two parties by no more than <span class="math inline">\(2 \log D\)</span>. To see this, imagine such a unitary <span class="math inline">\(U: a b \rightarrow a^{\prime} b^{\prime}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(d_{a}=d_{a^{\prime}}=d_{b}=d_{b^{\prime}}=D\)</span> applied to a state <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle_{A a B b}\)</span> where Alice holds systems <span class="math inline">\(A a\)</span> and Bob holds <span class="math inline">\(B b\)</span>. Then, the increase in entanglement achieved by applying <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(a b\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\Delta S_{ uni }=&amp;=S\left(A a^{\prime}\right)_{\rho_{A a^{\prime}}^{f}}-S(A a)_{\rho_{A a^{\prime}}^{i}} \\&amp;=S\left(a^{\prime} \mid A\right)_{\rho^{f}}-S(a \mid A)_{\rho^{i}} \\&amp; \leq S\left(a^{\prime}\right)+S(a) \leq 2 \log D\end{aligned}\]</span> Here we have used the notation of conditional entropy <span class="math inline">\(S(A \mid B)=S(A B)-S(B) .\)</span> We have also used the subadditivity of entropy, <span class="math inline">\(S(A B) \leq S(A)+S(B),\)</span> and the Araki-Lieb inequality: <span class="math inline">\(S(A \mid B) \geq-S(A)\)</span> (Ref. 25<span class="math inline">\()\)</span>. This is actually a simplified derivation of a bound found in 26 , which studies the general problem of entanglement generation via bipartite unitaries.</p><p>Next, assuming <span class="math inline">\(A=A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\)</span> is composed of subsystems, we derive an upper bound on the entropy change caused by measuring a constant fraction <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> of those subsystems. Letting <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be the collection of subsystems that are not measured, and <span class="math inline">\(M_{T^{c}}\)</span> be the classical outcomes of the measurement on the complement, <span class="math inline">\(T^{c}\)</span>, we see that the average entanglement-entropy change by measurement is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\Delta S_{\text {meas }} &amp;=\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T} \mid M_{T_{c}}\right)-S\left(A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\right) \\&amp; \leq \sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T}\right)-S\left(A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\right)\end{aligned}\]</span> We can use these two observations to conclude that small-scale volume-law-like scaling must saturate to an area law for sufficiently large sizes in any spatial dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. For the sake of contradiction, suppose our <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> consists of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> contiguous spins <span class="math inline">\(A_{1} \ldots A_{n},\)</span> and that the entropy of the system <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> scales as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}S\left(A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\right) &amp;=\gamma n+g(n) \\&amp;=\gamma|A|+g(|A|),\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g(|A|)=o(|A|)\)</span> is a correction term. Our goal is to upper bound <span class="math display">\[\Delta S_{\text {meas }} \leq-\gamma f|A|+o(|A|)\]</span> To this end, we apply Eq. <span class="math inline">\(36,\)</span> but we must handle a slight subtlety. While Eq. 38 posits only the asymptotic behavior of entropies of contiguous sets of spins, the right-hand side of Eq. 36 involves entropies of noncontiguous spins. To see how this works, fix <span class="math inline">\(T_{c}\)</span> (the spins being measured) and label the contiguous systems between successive points in <span class="math inline">\(T_{c}, V_{1}, \ldots, V_{k} .\)</span> The typical size of <span class="math inline">\(V_{i}\)</span> will be <span class="math inline">\(\approx 1 / f\)</span> and there will be <span class="math inline">\(k \approx f n\)</span> such contiguous sets.</p><p>We give two arguments. In the first argument, we assume a stronger requirement on our correction term, demanding <span class="math inline">\(g(n)=o(1)\)</span>. Given this, fixing a particular <span class="math inline">\(V_{i},\)</span> letting <span class="math inline">\(A_{L}\)</span> denote a large number of spins to the left of <span class="math inline">\(V_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_{R}\)</span> a large number to the right, strong subadditivity of entropy implies that <span class="math display">\[S\left(V_{i}\right) \leq S\left(A_{L} V_{i}\right)+S\left(V_{i} A_{R}\right)-S\left(A_{L} V_{i} A_{R}\right)\]</span> Applying the assumed scaling, this becomes <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}S\left(V_{i}\right) &amp; \leq \gamma\left(\left|A_{L}\right|+\left|V_{i}\right|\right)+\gamma\left(\left|V_{i}\right|+\left|A_{R}\right|\right) \\&amp;-\gamma\left(\left|A_{L}\right|+\left|V_{i}\right|+\left|A_{R}\right|\right)+o(1) \\&amp; \rightarrow \gamma\left|V_{i}\right|\end{aligned}\]</span> As a result, we find that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T}\right) &amp;=\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(V_{1} \ldots . V_{k}\right) \\&amp; \leq \sum_{T} p_{T} \sum_{i} S\left(V_{i}\right) \\&amp; \leq \sum_{T} p_{T} \gamma\left|V_{i}\right| \\&amp;=(1-f) \gamma n .\end{aligned}\]</span> Substitution into Eq.36 then yields Eq. 40 as desired. In the second argument, we allow a more relaxed scaling, where we do not require that the correction term <span class="math inline">\(g(n) \sim o(1),\)</span> but only require that the deviations around area law are independent and random (with mean zero) for different sets and over different realizations of <span class="math inline">\(T .\)</span> In this case we find <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T}\right) &amp;=\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(V_{1} \ldots V_{k}\right) \\&amp; \leq \sum_{T} p_{T} \sum_{i} S\left(V_{i}\right) \\&amp;=\sum_{T} p_{T} \sum_{i}\left(\gamma\left|V_{i}\right|+g\left(V_{i}\right)\right) \\&amp;=(1-f) \gamma n+\sum_{T} p_{T} \sum_{i}\left(g\left(V_{i}\right)\right) \\&amp;=(1-f) \gamma n+O(\sqrt{n})\end{aligned}\]</span> In both cases, we find <span class="math display">\[\sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T}\right) \leq(1-f) \gamma n+O(\sqrt{n})\]</span> so that the entropy change due to measurement satisfies <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\Delta S_{\text {meas }} &amp;=\leq \sum_{T} p_{T} S\left(A_{T}\right)-S\left(A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\right) \\&amp; \leq(1-f) \gamma n-\gamma n+o(n) \\&amp;=-f \gamma n+o(n)\end{aligned}\]</span> The change in entanglement entropy caused by one round of local unitaries satisfies <span class="math display">\[\Delta S_{ uni } \leq 2 l \log q \leq 2|\partial A| \log q\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> is the number of <span class="math inline">\(q \times q\)</span> unitaries that straddle the boundary between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, which is equal to the length of the boundary of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Combining this with the change in the entanglement entropy due to measurement gives us <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\Delta S_{\text {tot }} &amp;=\Delta S_{\text {meas }}+\Delta S_{\text {uni }} \\&amp; \leq-f \gamma|A|+2|\partial A| \log q+o(|A|) .\end{aligned}\]</span> Note that for sufficiently large <span class="math inline">\(n=|A|,\)</span> this becomes negative since <span class="math inline">\(|\partial A|\)</span> scales more slowly than <span class="math inline">\(|A| .\)</span> As a result, a stable entropy of form Eq. (38) cannot be achieved. In particular, if we hope for volume law scaling of the form <span class="math inline">\(S(A)=\gamma|A|,\)</span> we find positive entropy growth rate can only be sustained for <span class="math display">\[2|A|^{\frac{d-1}{d}} \log q \geq \gamma f|A|\]</span> which requires <span class="math display">\[|A| \leq\left(\frac{2 \log q}{\gamma f}\right)^{d}\]</span> Alternatively, volume law entanglement must break down around a saturation entropy <span class="math display">\[S_{\max } \approx \gamma\left(\frac{2 \log q}{\gamma f}\right)^{d}\]</span> We can also show that a strong volume-law behavior is impossible in <span class="math inline">\(1 D\)</span> with a simpler argument. Given a set <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> the local-unitary steps will tend to increase the entanglement entropy of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, while the projective measurements will tend to decrease it. Our goal is to identify the size at which these competing forces balance out. To understand the rate of entropy reduction due to measurements, we make some assumptions about the structure of the state on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In particular, we consider a situation where the entanglement entropy of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is nearly maximal (the state is nearly maximally mixed) and see how large an <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is consistent with this. In a sense, we are asking how big can <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be and be consisent with a very strong notion of volume law. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(|A|\)</span> spins. Then, after one step of measurements, a fraction <span class="math inline">\(f|A|\)</span> spins will be measured, and the resulting entropy will be <span class="math inline">\((1-f)|A| \log q\)</span> which is an entropy change of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S_{\text {meas }}=-f|A| \log q\)</span>. When a layer of local unitaries is applied, only two of the unitaries will straddle the edges of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (one at each end). The unitary step will therefore increase the entanglement entropy of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S_{\text {uni }} \leq 4 \log q .\)</span> So, after one unitary step and one measurement step, the change in entanglement entropy is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\Delta S_{ tot } &amp;=\Delta S_{\text {meas }}+\Delta S_{ uni } \\&amp; \leq 4 \log q-f|A| \log q .\end{aligned}\]</span> We therefore find <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S_{\text {tot }} \leq 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(4 \leq f|A|\)</span>. This suggests that for <span class="math inline">\(|A| \leq 4 / f,\)</span> unitary-projective dynamics will increase the entanglement entropy of <span class="math inline">\(A,\)</span> but that it will saturate around <span class="math inline">\(|A| \approx 4 / f\)</span>. This simple argument holds only for near-maximally mixed states on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p><h3 id="b.-logarithmic-corrections-and-phase-transitions">B. Logarithmic corrections and phase transitions</h3><p>Now we argue that our general argument does allow for logarithmic corrections to area laws, and also for phase transitions between area law phases with and without logarithmic corrections. The argument is simple: suppose the entropy scales as <span class="math display">\[S\left(A_{1} \ldots A_{n}\right)=\gamma|\partial A| \log |n|\]</span> An argument analogous to that presented in the previous subsection gives <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\Delta S_{\text {meas }} &amp; \leq \gamma|\partial A| \log (1-f) \\\Delta S_{\text {tot }} &amp; \leq 2|\partial A| \log q-\gamma|\partial A| \log (1-f)\end{aligned}\]</span> For <span class="math inline">\(f&lt;f_{c}=1-q^{2 / \gamma}\)</span> the upper bound on <span class="math inline">\(\Delta S\)</span> is positive, such that entropy growth of the form Eq. 66 can be sustained indefinitely, leading to a <span class="math inline">\(\log L\)</span> correction to area law behavior. For <span class="math inline">\(f&gt;f_{c}, \Delta S_{t o t}&lt;0,\)</span> and the scaling Eq.66 cannot be sustained, allowing only for a true area law.</p><h2 id="结论">结论</h2><p>In this work, we have investigated the entanglement dynamics of a system featuring a combination of unitary and projective time evolution, which have competing effects on quantum entanglement. We have argued that the effects of projection can keep the system in a state of low entanglement, featuring an area law for entanglement entropy, in contrast with the volume-law entanglement entropy resulting from generic pure unitary time evolution. We have constructed several toy models which capture the important features of unitary-projective evolution, such as the growth of short-range entanglement due to unitary evolution and the removal of entanglement at any scale by projective measurements. In the simplest model, described in the language of Bell pairs, an area-law phase persists down to arbitrarily low measurement rates. We have also shown that, starting from a product state, entanglement can often overshoot its late-time value prior to saturating to the area law. We then constructed a generalized cluster model which features an area-to-volume law transition at a finite critical measurement rate. We have tested this intuition in various concrete yet analytically tractable realizations of unitary-projective evolution. Specifically, we have studied Clifford evolution in one dimensional qubit systems, and Floquet random circuits in one dimension. In all cases, we find a stable area law phases. In some models, the area law phase persists to arbitrarily weak but non-zero measurement rates, whereas in others it gives way at a critical measurement rate to a low measurement volume law phase. We have further demonstrated that in the low measurement volume law phase there must be a subleading correction to the volume law (i.e. a strong volume law is impossible at any non-zero measurement rate).</p><p>We thus conclude that projective measurements can generically restrict systems to area law entanglement, at least for a sufficiently high measurement rate. This implies - counter-intuitively - that measurement of a quantum system can inhibit thermalization through local unitary time evolution, and help keep the system in a low entanglement state. This seems to be rather good news both for Fisher's model of quantum cognition, and for efforts to store and manipulate quantum information more generally.</p><p>The results of this manuscript are now consistent with numerical work by Li, Chen, and Fisher <span class="math inline">\(^{30,32}\)</span>, and by Skinner, Ruhman, and Nahum <span class="math inline">\(^{31}\)</span>. In Li, Chen, and Fisher, numerical data on unitary-projective evolution in systems of size up to <span class="math inline">\(L=500\)</span> was reported, and a phase transition was observed between a high measurement phase in which entanglement entropy reached a volume law. Meanwhile, Skinner, Ruhman and Nahum reported numerics on system sizes up to <span class="math inline">\(L=24,\)</span> and observed an analogous area-to-volume law transition.</p><p>Our work paves the way for future investigations into unitary-projective dynamics. There is much that remains unknown about the new measurement-driven area-law phase, as well as the area-to-volume law transition. The transition appears to have an important relationship with certain statistical mechanics models, such as percolation <span class="math inline">\(^{31}\)</span>, though the extent to which all properties of the transition can be understood in this language remains unclear. Regarding the new measurementdriven area-law phase itself, to what extent can the system be understood as an athermal 'localized' phase? Also, since area-law entanglement entropy is more commonly associated with quantum ground states, can the measurement-driven phase host unusual sorts of quantum orders, such as seen in the context of localization protected order? <span class="math inline">\(^{33}\)</span> There are many interesting questions remaining to be answered in this exciting new field.</p><h2 id="附录">附录</h2><p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\partial_{t} P(x)=&amp;-P(x)+(1-\tilde{f})\left[p_{s} P(x+1)\right. \\&amp;+\left.p_{g} P(x-1)+\left(1-p_{g}-p_{s}\right) P(x)\right]\end{aligned}\]</span></p><p><span class="math display">\[p_{s} P(x+1)-p_{s} P(x)\]</span></p><p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\lambda(1-\tilde{f}) \gamma-\tilde{f}+\frac{\tilde{f}}{\lambda+\mu}&amp;=0\\(\lambda+\mu)\lambda(1-\tilde{f}) \gamma-\tilde{f}(\lambda+\mu)+\tilde{f}&amp;=0\\\end{aligned}\]</span></p><p>你好哈刘珂，很抱歉以前说话比较冲，被你删了微信好友之后我有段时间很难受，反思之后现在和学弟学妹算是性格温和的老好人形象。看你在群里发的信息，应该是要毕业了，恭喜毕业。如果不介意，欢迎把冰箱卖给我。感谢。</p>]]></content>

Our goal is to further explore and characterize both the nature of the entanglement transition and the properties of the volume law entangled phase in the presence of weak measurements. A central focus is on generic circuits with randomness in both the unitary gates and in the locations of the measurement gates. The least constrained model we consider is a "random Haar circuit", with 2qubit unitaries taken from the Haar measure [15,16] and single qubit measurements randomly scattered across the circuit <span class="math inline">\([12,13] .\)</span> However, the high entanglement in the volume law phase poses formidable numerical challenges even in one dimension. We thus will largely study "random Clifford circuits" with the Haar unitaries replaced by random two-qubit Clifford unitaries, and the single qubit measurements restricted to the Pauli group $[17-$19]. Such Clifford circuits can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, enabling us to perform extensive large scale numerical studies.</p><h3 id="一些结论">一些结论</h3><p>We draw several conclusions from our data in the random Clifford circuit:</p><ol type="1"><li>At long times, measurements reduce the entanglement entropy from maximal, and the <strong>steady-state</strong> entanglement fluctuates weakly over time and over circuit realizations, <strong>independent of the initial conditions</strong>. These "typical" steady states are nonthermal, qualitatively distinct from thermal states.</li><li>The volume law phase <strong>persists</strong> when measurements are infrequent, consistent with results from Refs. <span class="math inline">\([13,14] .\)</span> The algebraic structure of the Clifford dynamics provides a convenient framework for characterizing the entanglement structure of these wavefunctions, revealing an unusual scaling form of the entanglement entropy, namely <span class="math inline">\(S_{A}=\alpha \ln |A|+\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s|A|\)</span> for a contiguous subsystem <span class="math inline">\(A .\)</span> The sub-leading logarithm is exposed by analyzing the length distributions of the "stabilizers"- mutually commuting Pauli string (eigen)operators of the Clifford wavefunctions with unit eigenvalue. The stabilizer distribution is "bimodal", consisting of a power law distribution of "short" stabilizers that contribute to the logarithm, and "long stabilizers" with length <span class="math inline">\(\ell \approx L / 2\)</span> giving the volume law piece <span class="math inline">\((L\)</span> being the system size <span class="math inline">\() .\)</span> This logarithmic correction is conjectured to be a generic feature of volume law steady states in the presence of measurements.</li><li>The "<strong>entanglement transition</strong>", from volume law to area law states <span class="math inline">\([13,14],\)</span> occurs when the weight under the "long stabilizer" peak at <span class="math inline">\(\ell \approx L / 2\)</span> vanishes continuously upon approaching <span class="math inline">\(p_{c}\)</span> from below. Remarkably, the power law tail of "short" stabilizers remains, implying a purely logarithmic form for the entanglement entropy right at the critical point, <span class="math inline">\(p=p_{c} .\)</span> The entanglement transition exhibits <strong>conformal symmetry</strong> of the mutual information at criticality, and we extract several critical exponents. In particular, we find that in all the models we study, the mutual information between two small regions separated by a large distance, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, scales as <span class="math inline">\(1 / r^{4}\)</span>. Off criticality the mutual information decays exponentially.</li><li>We explore the fluctuations of certain spin-spin correlation functions across the transition, and find that they are enhanced at the critical point, mimicking the mutual information.</li></ol><p>We establish the generality of these results by exploring models with imposed spatial symmetry constraints specifically Clifford circuits with the unitaries periodic in space and time (Floquet) and/or the measurement locations periodic in space and time. All models are found to exhibit a measurement-driven entanglement transition, with similar exponents and similar behavior of the stabilizer length distribution as in the random Clifford circuit. Apparently the randomness in the unitaries and measurement locations are inessential, with the remaining stochasticity in the measurement outcomes sufficient to account for the presence and universality of the entanglement transition.</p><h3 id="超越clifford">超越Clifford</h3><p>Going beyond Clifford, we implement a full quantum simulation of <strong>more general circuit</strong> models for systems with size up to <span class="math inline">\(L=20\)</span> qubits. Both random Haar circuits and (non-Clifford) Floquet circuits exhibit behavior consistent with their Clifford counterparts. We also explore models with (non-projective) "generalized measurements", with each and every qubit being measured at each time step, and find evidence for an entanglement transition, with accessible exponents being consistent with the Clifford circuits.

In Sec. II we define the circuit models of interest. Extensive numerical results for Clifford circuits are reported in Sec. III and IV. In particular, Sec.

IV is devoted to a detailed analysis of the critical behavior of the entanglement transition. In Sec. V, we systematically explore Clifford circuit models with space and time symmetries imposed, either in the unitaries or the measurement locations - or both. In Sec.

The lowest order perturbative correction to the self-energy due to the strong gauge field fluctuations suggests that there is no well defined Landau-quasi-particle. Therefore, we cannot assume the existence of the Landau-quasi-particles a priori in the derivation of the QBE. Using an alternative formulation, we derive the QBE for the generalized Fermi surface displacement which corresponds to the local variation of the chemical potential in momentum space. From this QBE, one can understand in a unified fashion the Fermi-liquid behaviors of the density-density and the current-current correlation functions at <span class="math inline">\(\nu=1 / 2\)</span> (in the long wave length and the low frequency limits) and the singular behavior of the energy gap obtained from the finite temperature activation behavior of the compressibility near <span class="math inline">\(\nu=1 / 2 .\)</span> Implications of these results to the recent experiments are also discussed.</p><h3 id="介绍">介绍</h3><p>since the discovery of the integer (IQH) and fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effects the two-dimensional electron system in strong magnetic fields has often surprised us. Among recent developements, a lot of attention has been given to the appearance of the new metallic state at the filling fraction <span class="math inline">\(\nu=1 / 2[1]\)</span> and the associated Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations of the longitudinal resistance around <span class="math inline">\(\nu=1 / 2[2,3] .\)</span> The similarity between these phenamena near <span class="math inline">\(\nu=1 / 2\)</span> and those of electrons in weak magnetic fields was successfully explained by the composite fermion approach [4]. Using the fermionic Chern-Simons gauge theory of the composite fermions [5,6] , Halperin, Lee, and Read (HLR) developed a theory that describes the new metallic state at <span class="math inline">\(\nu=1 / 2[6]\)</span>.</p><p>A composite fermion is obtained by attaching an even number <span class="math inline">\(2 n\)</span> of flux quanta to an electron, and the transformation can be realized by introducing an appropriate Chern-Simons gauge field. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{4-6}\)</span> At the mean-field level, one takes into account only the average of the statistical magnetic field due to the attached magnetic flux. If the interaction between fermions is ignored, the system can be described as the free fermions in an effective magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(\Delta B=B-B_{1 / 2 n},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(B_{1 / 2 n}=2 n n_{e} h c / e\)</span> is the averaged statistical magnetic field, and <span class="math inline">\(n_{e}\)</span> is the density of electrons. Therefore, in mean-field theory, the FQH states with <span class="math inline">\(v=p /(2 n p+1)\)</span> can be described as the IQH states of the composite fermions with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> -filled Landau levels occupied in an effective magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(\Delta B .{ }^{4-6}\)</span> In particular, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta B=0\)</span> at the filling fractions <span class="math inline">\(v=1 / 2 n,\)</span> so that the ground state of the system is the filled Fermi sea with a well-defined Fermi wave vector <span class="math inline">\(k_{F} .^{6,7}\)</span> As a result, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations near <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> can be explained by the presence of a well-defined Fermi wave vector at <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2} .^{6}\)</span> The mean-field energy gap of the system with <span class="math inline">\(v=p /(2 p+1)\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(p \rightarrow \infty\)</span> limit is given by <span class="math inline">\(E_{g}=e \Delta B / m c,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the mass of the composite fermions. Note that, in the large- <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{c}\)</span> limit, the finite <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is caused by the Coulomb interaction between the fermions. The effective mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> should be chosen such that the Fermi energy <span class="math inline">\(E_{F}\)</span> is given by the Coulomb energy scale.</p><p>There are a number of experiments which show that there is a well-defined Fermi wave vector at <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2} .^{8-10}\)</span> They observed the geometrical resonances between the semiclassical orbit of the composite fermions and another length scale artificially introduced to the system near <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2}\)</span></p><p>However, it is possible that fluctuations and twoparticle interactions, which are ignored in the mean-field theory, are very important. Note that the density fluctuations correspond to the fluctuations of the statistical magnetic field. Therefore, the density fluctuations above the mean-field state induce the gauge-field fluctuations. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{5,6}\)</span> If the fermions are interacting via a two-particle interaction <span class="math inline">\(v( q )=V_{0} / q^{2-\eta}(1 \leq \eta \leq 2),\)</span> the effects of the gaugefield fluctuations can be modified. In fact, the gauge-field fluctuations become more singular as the interaction range becomes shorter (larger <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> ). The reason is that the <span class="math inline">\(\begin{array}{llll}\text { longer-range } &amp; \text { interaction } &amp; \text { (smaller } &amp; \eta \text { ) suppresses } &amp; \text { more }\end{array}\)</span> effectively the density fluctuations, and thus induces the less singular gauge-field fluctuations. Therefore, it is important to examine whether the mean-field Fermi-liquid state is stable against the gauge-field fluctuations, which also includes the effects of the two-particle interaction.</p><p>One way to study the stability of the mean-field Fermi-liquid state is to examine the low-energy behavior of the self-energy correction induced by the gauge-field fluctuations. It is found that the most singular contribution to the self-energy <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma( k , \omega)\)</span> comes from the transverse part of the gauge-field fluctuations. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{6}{ }^{11}\)</span> The lowest-order perturbative correction to the self-energy (due to the transverse gauge field) has been calculated by several authors. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{6,11}\)</span> It turns out that <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Re} \Sigma \sim \operatorname{Im} \Sigma \sim \omega^{2 /(1+\eta)}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(1&lt;\eta \leq 2,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Re} \Sigma \sim \omega \ln \omega, \operatorname{Im} \Sigma \sim \omega\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\eta=1\)</span> (Coulomb interaction). Thus the Landau criterion for the quasiparticle is violated in the case of <span class="math inline">\(1&lt;\eta \leq 2,\)</span> and the case of <span class="math inline">\(\eta=1\)</span> shows marginal Fermi-liquid behavior. In both cases, the effective mass of the fermions diverges, as <span class="math inline">\(m^{*} / m \propto\left|\xi_{k}\right|^{-(\eta-1) /(\eta+1)} \quad\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\quad 1&lt;\eta \leq 2, \quad\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\quad\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(m^{*} / m \propto\left|\ln \xi_{k}\right|\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\eta=1,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\xi_{k}=\left(k^{2} / 2 m\right)-\mu,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the chemical potential. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{6}\)</span> In a self-consistent treatment of the self-energy, <span class="math inline">\({ }^{6}\)</span> the energy gap of the system in the presence of a small <span class="math inline">\(\begin{array}{llllll}\text { effective } &amp; \text { magnetic } &amp; \text { field } &amp; \Delta B &amp; \text { can } &amp; \text { be } &amp; \text { determined } &amp; \text { as }\end{array}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(E_{g} \propto|\Delta B|^{(1+\eta) / 2}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(1&lt;\eta \leq 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_{g} \propto|\Delta B| /|\ln \Delta B|\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\eta=1 .\)</span> Therefore, the energy gap of the system vanishes faster than the mean-field prediction, or, equivalently, the effective mass diverges in a singular way as <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> is approached. These results suggest that the effective Fermi velocity of the fermion <span class="math inline">\(v_{F}^{*}\)</span> goes to zero at <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> even though the Fermi wave vector <span class="math inline">\(k_{F}\)</span> is finite and the quasiparticles have a very short lifetime <span class="math inline">\(\tau \approx(T /\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\left.\varepsilon_{F}\right)^{-2 /(1+\eta)}\left(1 / \varepsilon_{F}\right),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the temperature and <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{F}\)</span> is the Fermi energy. However, a recent magnetic focusing experiment <span class="math inline">\({ }^{10}\)</span> suggests that the fermion has a long lifetime or a long mean free path which seems inconsistent with the above picture.</p><p>since the one-particle Green's function is not gauge invariant, the singular self-energy could be an artifact of the gauge choice. To address this question, we recently examined the lowest-order perturbative corrections to the gauge-invariant <span class="math inline">\(\quad\)</span> density-density and current-current correlation functions. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{12}\)</span> It was found that there are important cancellations between the self-energy corrections 12,13 and the vertex corrections due to the Ward identity. As a result, the density-density and current-current correlation functions show a Fermi-liquid behavior for all ratios of <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_{F} q \cdot{ }^{12}\)</span> In particular, the edge of the <span class="math inline">\(\begin{array}{lllll}\text { particle-hole } &amp; \text { continuum } &amp; \omega=v_{F} q &amp; \text { is } &amp; \text { essentially } &amp; \text { not }\end{array}\)</span> changed, which may suggest a finite effective mass. From the current-current correlation function, the transport scattering rate (due to the transverse part of the gauge field) is given by <span class="math inline">\(1 / \tau_{ tr } \propto \omega^{4 /(1+\eta)}&lt;&lt;\omega\)</span> after the cancellation (the scattering rate would be much larger, <span class="math inline">\(1 / \tau_{ tr } \propto \omega^{2 /(1+\eta)} \gg \omega,\)</span> had we ignored the vertex correction). <span class="math inline">\({ }^{12}\)</span> Therefore, the fermions have a long transport lifetime, which explains a long free path in the magnetic focusing experiment. <span class="math inline">\(\quad\)</span> From these results, one may suspect whether the divergent mass obtained from the self-energy has any physical meaning.</p><p>However, due to the absence of the underlying quasiparticle picture, we cannot simply conclude that fermions have a finite effective mass associated with the long lifetime which was obtained from the <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{small}-q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-\omega\)</span>. behaviors of the density-density and current-current correlation functions. In fact, it is found that <span class="math inline">\(2 k_{F}\)</span> response functions show singular behaviors compared to the usual Fermi-liquid theory. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{13}\)</span> We also like to mention that recent experiments on the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> have observed some features which were interpreted as a sign of the divergent effective mass of the fermions as <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> is approached. The experimentally determined effective mass diverges in a more singular way than any theoretical prediction. However, their deter-mination of the effective mass is based on a theory for the noninteracting fermions, and also the disorder effect is very important near <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> because the static fluctuations of the density due to the impurities induce an additional static random magnetic field. since there is no satisfactory theory in the presence of disorder, it is difficult to compare the present theory and the experiments.</p><p>In order to answer the question about the effective mass, it is important to examine other gauge-invariant quantities which may potentially show a divergent effective mass. In a recent paper, <span class="math inline">\({ }^{14}\)</span> we calculated the lowest-order perturbative correction to the compressibility with a fixed <span class="math inline">\(\Delta B\)</span>, which shows a thermally activated behavior when the chemical potential lies exactly at the middle of the successive effective Landau levels. It turns out that the corrections to the activation energy gap and the corresponding effective mass are singular, and consistent with previous self-consistent treatment of the selfenergy. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{6}\)</span> Thus it is necessary to understand the apparently different behaviors of the density-density correlation function at <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> and the activation energy gap determined from the compressibility near <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2}\)</span></p><p>One resolution of the problem was suggested by Stern and Halperin <span class="math inline">\(^{15}\)</span> within the usual Landau-Fermi-liquid theory framework. The idea is that both the effective mass and Landau-interaction function are singular in such a way that they cancel each other in the densitydensity correlation function. Recently, Stern and Halperin <span class="math inline">\(^{15}\)</span> put forward this idea and constructed a Fermiliquid theory of the fermion-gauge system in the case of Coulomb interaction. Even though the use of the Landau-Fermi-liquid theory or equivalently the existence of well-defined quasiparticles can be marginally justified in the case of the Coulomb interaction, we feel that it is necessary to construct a more general framework which applies to the arbitrary two-particle interaction <span class="math inline">\((1&lt;\eta \leq 2\)</span> as well as <span class="math inline">\(\eta=1\)</span>, and allows us to check the validity of the Fermi-liquid theory and to judge when the divergent mass shows up. In particular, it is worthwhile to provide a unified picture for understanding previous theoretical studies. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{16-24}\)</span></p><p>In the usual Fermi-liquid theory, the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE) of the quasiparticles provides useful information about the low-lying excitations of the system. Our objective is to construct a similar QBE which describes all the low-energy physics of the composite fermion system. One important difficulty we are facing here is that we cannot assume the existence of the quasiparticles <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> priori in the derivation of the <span class="math inline">\(QBE\)</span>, even though the conventional derivation of the QBE of the Fermi-liquid theory relies on the existence of these quasiparticles. Following closely the work of Prange and Kadanoff <span class="math inline">\(^{25}\)</span> about the electron-phonon system, where there is also no well-defined quasiparticle at temperatures high compared with the Debye temperature, we concentrate on a generalized Fermi-surface displacement which, in our case, corresponds to the local variation of the chemical potential in momentum space. Due to the nonexistence of a well-defined quasiparticle, the usual distribution function <span class="math inline">\(n_{k}\)</span> in the momentum space cannot be described by a closed equation of motion. However, we will see below that the generalized Fermi surface displacement does satisfy a closed equation of motion. This equation of motion will be also called QBE.</p><p>We use the nonequilibrium Green's-function technique <span class="math inline">\(^{26-28}\)</span> to derive the <span class="math inline">\(QBE\)</span> and calculate the generalized Landau-interaction function which has frequency dependence as well as the usual angular dependence due to the retarded nature of the gauge interaction. The <span class="math inline">\(QBE\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> consists of three parts. One is the contribution from the self-energy correction which gives the singular mass correction, the other one comes from the generalized Landau-interaction function, and finally it contains the collision integral. These quantities are calculated to the lowest order in the coupling to the gauge field.</p><p>By studying the dynamic properties of the collective modes using the QBE, we find that the smooth fluctuations of the Fermi surface (or the small angular momentum modes) show the usual Fermi-liquid behavior, while the rough fluctuations (or the large angular momentum modes) show the singular behavior determined by the <span class="math inline">\(\begin{array}{llll}\text { singular } &amp; \text { self-energy } &amp; \text { correction. } &amp; \text { Here } &amp; \text { the } &amp; \text { angular }\end{array}\)</span> momentum is the conjugate variable of the angle measured from a given direction in momentum space. There is a forward scattering cancellation between the singular <span class="math inline">\(\begin{array}{llll}\text { self-energy } &amp; \text { correction } &amp; \text { and } \text { the } &amp; \text { singular } &amp; \text { (generalized) }\end{array}\)</span> Landau-interaction function and a similar cancellation exists in the collision integral as far as the small angular momentum modes <span class="math inline">\(l&lt;l_{c}\left(l_{c} \propto \Omega^{-1 /(1+\eta)},\right.\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is the small external frequency) are concerned. However, in the case of the large angular momentum modes <span class="math inline">\(l&gt;l_{c},\)</span> the contribution from the Landau-interaction function becomes very small so that the self-energy correction dominates, and the collision integral also cannot be ignored in general. In this case the behaviors of the low-lying modes are very different from those in the Fermi liquids.</p><p>If we ignore the collision integral, it can be shown that the system has numerous collective modes between <span class="math inline">\(\Omega \propto q^{(1+\eta) / 2}(1&lt;\eta \leq 2), \Omega \propto q /|\ln q|(\eta=1),\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Omega=v_{F} q\)</span> while there is the particle-hole continuum below <span class="math inline">\(\Omega \propto q^{(1+\eta) / 2}(1&lt;\eta \leq 2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Omega \propto q /|\ln q|(\eta=1) .\)</span> The dis- tinction between these two types of low-lying excitations is obscured by the existence of the collision integral.</p><p>From the above results, we see that the density-density and current-current correlation functions, being dominated by the small angular momentum modes <span class="math inline">\(l&lt;l_{c},\)</span> show the usual Fermi-liquid behavior. On the other hand, the energy gap away from <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> is determined by the behaviors of the large angular momentum modes <span class="math inline">\(l&gt;l_{c}\)</span>, so that the singular mass correction shows up in the energy gap of the system.</p><p>The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the model and explain the way we construct the QBE without assuming the existence of the quasiparticles. In Sec. III, the QBE for the generalized distribution function is derived for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta B=0 .\)</span> In Sec. IV, we construct the QBE for the generalized Fermi-surface displacement for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta B=0 .\)</span> We also determine the generalized Landau-interaction function and discuss its consequences. In Sec. <span class="math inline">\(V,\)</span> the <span class="math inline">\(Q B E\)</span> in the presence of a small <span class="math inline">\(\Delta B\)</span> is constructed, and the energy gap of the system is determined. In Sec. VI, we discuss the collective excitations of the system for the cases of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta B=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta B \neq 0\)</span>. We conclude the paper and discuss the implications of our results to experiments in Sec. VII. We concentrate on the zero-temperature case in the main text and provide the derivation of the QBE at finite temperatures in the Appendix, which requires some special treatments compared to the zero-temperature counterpart.</p><h3 id="缺乏准粒子下的玻尔兹曼方程">缺乏准粒子下的玻尔兹曼方程</h3><p>Two-dimensional electrons interacting via a twoparticle interaction can be transformed to composite fermions interacting via the same two-particle interaction, and also coupled to an appropriate Chern-Simons gauge field which appears due to the statistical magnetic flux quanta attached to each electron. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{5,6}\)</span> The model can be constructed as follows <span class="math inline">\((h=e=c=1)\)</span> <span class="math display">\[Z=\int D \psi D \psi^{*} D a_{\mu} e^{i \int d t d^{2} r L }\]</span> where the Lagrangian density <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}L =&amp; \psi^{*}\left(\partial_{0}+i a_{0}-\mu\right) \psi-\frac{1}{2 m} \psi^{*}\left(\partial_{i}-i a_{i}+i A_{i}\right)^{2} \psi \\&amp;-\frac{i}{2 \pi \widetilde{\phi}} a_{0} \varepsilon^{i j} \partial_{i} a_{j} \\&amp;+\frac{1}{2} \int d^{2} r^{\prime} \psi^{*}( r ) \psi( r ) v\left( r - r ^{\prime}\right) \psi^{*}\left( r ^{\prime}\right) \psi\left( r ^{\prime}\right)\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> represents the fermion field and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{\phi}\)</span> is an even number <span class="math inline">\(2 n\)</span> which is the number of flux quanta attached to an electron, and <span class="math inline">\(v( r ) \propto V_{0} / r^{\eta}\)</span> is the Fourier transform of <span class="math inline">\(v( q )=V_{0} / q^{2-\eta}(1 \leq \eta \leq 2)\)</span> which represents the interaction between the fermions. <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the external vector potential <span class="math inline">\((B=\nabla \times A ),\)</span> and we choose the Coulomb gauge <span class="math inline">\(\nabla \cdot a =0\)</span> for the Chern-Simons gauge field.

This coupled set of equations for the electron and phonon <strong>distribution functions</strong> is correct even in the situation in which the electronic excitation spectrum has considerable width and structure so that one might not expect a priori that there would be well-defined <strong>quasiparticles</strong>. Nonetheless, one of the forms of the electronic transport equation is identical to the transport equation suggested by Landau for the case in which the quasiparticle energy is well defined. The transport equations may be written in two different forms:</p><ol type="1"><li>In the first form, the electronic distribution function is labeled by a momentum vector;</li><li>in the second, the labels are excitation energy and the position on the Fermi surface.</li></ol><p>Despite the width in the spectrum, the momentum-space form is identical with the Landau quasiparticle theory. The energy space form is slightly simpler because no wave function renormalization constants appear in the definition of the energies or in the scattering matrix elements. In fact, in the case in which there is space dependence but no time dependence this form of the transport equations looks identical to the weak-coupling Boltzmann equations. This identity is used to prove that to the accuracy of the adiabatic approximation the several transport coefficients are completely unchanged by the many-body effects of the electron-phonon interaction. These coefficients, which include the spin diffusivity and the viscosity as well as the ordinary conductivities and all the classical galvanomagne to thermal effects are thus correctly predicted by the standard weak-coupling theory. Many-body effects are also absent in <span class="math inline">\(d n / d \mu\)</span> and the spin susceptibility; however, they do appear in the specific heat and in the response to time-dependent disturbances.</p><h3 id="介绍">2 介绍</h3><p>(现象：电子在多体系统中表现得像独立粒子。朗道给出解释：和无相互作用系统的低能激发一一对应)It is remarkable that many experiments on manybody systems can be described by the independent particle model. Especially for metals, it was unclear why many-body effects were not more pronounced, but a number of years ago, Landau, in a famous series of papers, shed a great deal of light on the problem. Landau pointed out that the low-lying excited states of a Fermion system might very well have a natural oneto-one correspondence with the low-lying states of the noninteracting system. (基于对应发展出输运方程，计算平衡态性质) On the basis of this correspondence, he was able to obtain the equilibrium properties, and also the transport equations describing situations not far removed from equilibrium. The equations describe a set of weakly interacting quasiparticles. The main difference between this case and the limit of really weak interactions is that the quasiparticles have a modified energy-momentum relation and that there is a <strong>modification</strong> of the scattering matrix elements.</p><p>The Landau theory is phenomenological(表象理论，但是很重要), since it introduces unknown functions as phenomenological parameters. Nevertheless, it is of enormous importance, since it catalogs completely the phenomena of the systems that it describes, and since it provides a target for theorists who wish to start from a less phenomenological viewpoint. Several important advances have been made along this line. We mention the work of Luttinger and Nozières, <span class="math inline">\({ }^{2}\)</span> who show that as long as perturbation theory is formally correct, the Landau theory follows（只要微扰理论是对的，朗道的理论就是有效的）. That is, if the formal sum of perturbation series has certain crucial properties shared by individual terms in the series, then the Landau theory holds. Baym and Kadanoff <span class="math inline">\(^{3}\)</span> made rather different arguments based upon the theory of Green's functions.</p><h4 id="准粒子">准粒子</h4><p>（准粒子的概念）The theories of quasiparticles so far mentioned have relied upon the following idea: If one considers an electron of definite momentum near the Fermi surface, one finds that it has a component with well-defined energy, that is, its lifetime is very long. The reason is that the phase space for the possible decay products of the electron is very small, because of the Pauli principle.</p><blockquote><p>（在声电作用力下，准粒子概念是否有效）In this paper, we investigate the question of whether a quasiparticle theory can be said to hold for the system of electrons and phonons.</p></blockquote><p>The previously mentioned work has been restricted to a system of Fermions interacting by means of instantaneous forces, as, for example, Coulomb repulsions. There have been suggestions recently that the quasiparticle picture fails for electron-phonon systems. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{4,5}\)</span> Partially, this is a matter of semantics. （只要系统可以用Boltzmann方程描述，我们就说准粒子的图像有效，不能因为矩阵元素重整化就说准粒子失效）We shall say that we have a quasiparticle theory if the system is described by a Boltzmann equation of the form suggested by Landau, even though various matrix elements, as well as the energy-momentum relations, are "renormalized." We shall not regard it as a failure of the quasiparticle concept if it turns out that the matrix-element (wave function) renormalization is nontrivial.</p><p>运用准粒子概念更深刻的一个例子，当能量高于一个特征能量，电子会快速释放声子，所以电子的能量就不能被定义。推论：温度不能高于Debye 温度，高能态不能重要，不然准粒子的概念就失效了。A more profound objection to the use of the quasiparticle concept in the electron-phonon system is that an electron injected into the system with a definite momentum cannot be said to have a definite energy, if this energy is above the Fermi energy by as much as <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{0},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{0}\)</span> is a typical or <strong>maximum phonon energy</strong> (the Debye frequency). Such electrons so rapidly emit phonons that their energy cannot be defined. If such comparatively highly excited electronic states are not of importance, there is no difficulty in extending the usual arguments leading to the Landau theory to the electron-phonon case as well. This will be the case provided we consider only perturbations varying slowly enough in space and time, and provided we restrict the temperature to be well below the Debye temperature.

(15) implies <span class="math inline">\(^{11}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\left[\omega-\epsilon_{k}\right.&amp;-\Sigma(\hat{k}, E), f(\hat{k}, E)]-\left[\Sigma^{&lt;}(\hat{k}, E), \int \frac{d \epsilon}{2 \pi} g(\epsilon, \hat{k}, E)\right] \\&amp;=-\Sigma^{&gt;}(\hat{k}, E) f(\hat{k}, E)+\Sigma^{&lt;}(\hat{k}, E)[1-f(\hat{k}, E)]\end{aligned}\]</span> We can eliminate the term involving <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in Eq. (29) if we notice that <span class="math display">\[\int \frac{d \epsilon}{2 \pi} g(\epsilon, \hat{k}, E)= O \int \frac{d \epsilon d E^{\prime}}{(2 \pi)^{2}} \frac{A\left(\epsilon, \hat{k}, E^{\prime}\right)}{E-E^{\prime}}=\rho \int \frac{d E^{\prime}}{2 \pi} \frac{1}{E-E^{\prime}}\]</span> This is not, strictly speaking, well defined but all derivatives of this object certainly vanish. Therefore, Eq. (29) becomes <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}&amp;\left[1-\frac{\partial}{\partial E} \Sigma_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)\right] \frac{\partial}{\partial t} f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)+\frac{\partial \Sigma_{\sigma}}{\partial t}(\hat{k}, E) \frac{\partial f_{\sigma}}{\partial E}(\hat{k}, E) +\left(\nabla_{ k _{F}} \epsilon_{ k _{F}}\right) \cdot \nabla_{ r } f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E) \\=&amp;-\Sigma_{\sigma}^{&gt;}(\hat{k}, E) f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)+\Sigma_{\sigma}&lt;(\hat{k}, E)\left[1-f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)\right]\end{aligned}\]</span> when the brackets are evaluated and terms like <span class="math display">\[\nabla_{ k } \Sigma \cdot \nabla_{ r } f=O\left[\left(\Sigma / k_{0}\right)\left|\nabla_{ r } f\right|\right]\]</span> are neglected. This neglect requires <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma \ll \mu\)</span> which is certainly very well satisfied in the metal.</p><p>The derivation of the phonon transport equation is slightly more complicated. We first study the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Re} \Pi( q \omega),\)</span> given by <span class="math display">\[\operatorname{Re\Pi}(q \omega)=\frac{\partial}{2 \pi} \int d \omega^{\prime} \frac{\Pi^{&gt;}\left( q , \omega^{\prime}\right)-\Pi^{&lt;}\left( q , \omega^{\prime}\right)}{\omega-\omega^{\prime}}-\Pi_{ q }\]</span> The values of <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> of greatest interest to us are of order <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{0}\)</span>. As Migdal has shown, the values of <span class="math inline">\(\omega^{\prime}\)</span> contributing appreciably to the integral in (31) are much larger, of order <span class="math inline">\(\mu .\)</span> Consequently, the electron distributions on which (31) depends must be evaluated at energies remote from the Fermi energy. Far from the Fermi surface, the electron states are either full or empty, independent of the slight ripples on the Fermi sea which represent the deviation from equilibrium. Indeed, these electron states are uninfluenced by the electronphonon interaction altogether. We may therefore compute <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Re} \Pi(q, \omega)\)</span> with great accuracy by using the formula (12) for <span class="math inline">\(\Pi^{&gt;},&lt;(q, \omega)\)</span> and putting for the electron distribution functions in (12), the functions of the noninteracting system at zero temperature.</p><p>It follows from the above arguments that <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Re} \Pi( q , \omega)\)</span> is practically independent of frequency, for frequencies of order <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{0}\)</span>. We choose it to vanish by picking <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_{ q }\)</span> to be <span class="math display">\[\Pi_{ q }=\frac{\partial}{2 \pi} \int d \omega^{\prime} \frac{\Pi^{&gt;}\left( q , \omega^{\prime}\right)-\Pi^{&lt;}\left( q , \omega^{\prime}\right)}{-\omega^{\prime}}\]</span> By this choice, we achieve the relation, valid for all <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\operatorname{Re\Pi}( q , \omega) / \omega=O\left(\omega_{0}^{2} / \mu^{2}\right)\]</span> which allows us to neglect ReII completely. Next we remark that the absorptive part of <span class="math inline">\(\Pi( q , z)\)</span> which we have denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma( q , z),\)</span> is very small. It can be easily computed from Eq. (28) for, the entire frequency range. Migdal has computed this quantity in the equilibrium case, for which it is true that <span class="math display">\[\gamma_{\text {equil }}( q , \omega) / \omega=O\left(\omega_{0} / \mu\right)\]</span> One finds an additional contribution to <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> arising from the deviation of the system away from equilibrium. This contribution is easily estimated as <span class="math display">\[\gamma_{\text {nonequil }}( q , \omega)=U \omega_{0} / \mu\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is a certain average displacement in energy of the electron states at the Fermi surface, away from their equilibrium values. This deviation from equilibrium we have assumed is small, so that we have <span class="math inline">\(U \lesssim \omega_{0}\)</span>. It is important to note, and easy to verify, that the frequency dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is entirely contained in the equilibrium term which is simply proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\omega .\)</span> This is the case for the interesting range <span class="math inline">\(|\omega| \ll \mu\)</span></p><p>Thus we conclude that both the dispersive and absorptive parts of <span class="math inline">\(\Pi( q , z)\)</span> are very small. For nearly all purposes, we can completely neglect both. This result immediately justifies the neglect of the function <span class="math inline">\(s( q , z)\)</span> which appears in Eq. <span class="math inline">\((9) .\)</span> If <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is allowed to approach a real positive frequency, the correction in Eq. (9a) can be estimated as being of order <span class="math inline">\([\Pi(q w)]^{2} /\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\left(\omega+\omega_{0}\right),\)</span> which is completely negligible. From Eq. (16) it follows that <span class="math display">\[r^{&gt;}( q , \omega)-r^{&lt;}( q , \omega)=\gamma( q , \omega) /\left[\left(\omega-\omega_{q}\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{4} \gamma^{2}\right]\]</span> which is strongly peaked as a function of frequency about <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{ q }\)</span>. The peak has an area <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi .\)</span> Thus, we are enabled to define the phonon distribution function as <span class="math display">\[N( q ; r , t)=\int \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi}^{&lt;}( q , \omega ; r , t)\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[N( q ; r , t)+1=\int \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi} r( q , \omega ; r , t)\]</span> where the integration is over the peaking of the integrand. Integrating Eq. (16) over the region of the peaking gives at once <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} N( q ; r , t)+\nabla_{ q } \omega_{ q } \cdot \nabla_{ r } N( q ; r , t)\)</span> <span class="math display">\[=\Pi^{&lt;}\left(q \omega_{ q }\right)[N( q )+1]-\Pi^{&lt;}\left(q \omega_{ q }\right) N(q)\]</span> We are able to drop the term <span class="math inline">\(\left[\Pi^{&lt;}, \operatorname{Re} r\right],\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(II ^{&lt;},\)</span> is smoothly varying at <span class="math inline">\(\omega=\omega_{ q }\)</span> Equation (35) is the phonon Boltzmann equation. We shall require the form of <span class="math inline">\(r^{&gt;}&lt;( q , \omega)\)</span> for larger values of <span class="math inline">\(\omega-\omega_{q}\)</span> later. It is evident from (33) that we expect these quantities to drop off as <span class="math inline">\(\left(\omega-\omega_{q}\right)^{-2} .\)</span> Direct substitution shows that the relation <span class="math display">\[r^{&gt;},&lt;( q , \omega)=-\Pi^{&gt;},&lt;\partial / \partial \omega(\operatorname{Re} r)=\delta r^{&gt;},&lt;\]</span> holds for large <span class="math inline">\(\omega-\omega_{ q } .\)</span> The quantity <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Re} r\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\operatorname{Re} r=\left(\omega-\omega_{ q }\right) /\left[\left(\omega-\omega_{ q }\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{4} \gamma^{2}\right]\]</span> and can be approximated as <span class="math inline">\(P \left(1 /\left(\omega-\omega_{ q }\right)\right)\)</span> in view of the smallness of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</p><p>Thus, <span class="math inline">\(r^{&gt;}(\omega)\)</span> for example, has approximately a Lorentzian shape, with tails dropping off as <span class="math inline">\(\left(\omega-\omega_{q}\right)^{-2}\)</span>. There is some important structure in the tail, in the neighborhood of zero frequency, since <span class="math inline">\(r^{&gt;}\)</span> must vanish exponentially as <span class="math inline">\(e^{\beta \omega}\)</span> for negative frequency. This structure depends on the deviation of the system from equilibrium. Only the response of the ions represented by the main peak of <span class="math inline">\(r^{&gt;}&lt;\)</span> can truly be considered as a phonon response with a definite energy-momentum relation. The incoherent contribution of <span class="math inline">\(\delta r^{&gt;},&lt;,\)</span> which is rarely important at all, will turn out to give the ionic contribution to the electronic quasiparticles. We shall return to this point later, when we have seen the explicit role played by the line shape.</p><p>The fact that <span class="math inline">\(A( k , E)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r^{&gt;}-r^{&lt;}\)</span> are Lorentzian rather than true <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> functions in the variables <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, respectively, is of no consequence in the calculation of those values of <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{&gt;}&lt;\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Pi^{&gt;}&lt;\)</span> which enter the equations of motion, Eqs. (30) and (35). Thus we can immediately write, <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{r}\Sigma_{\sigma}&gt;(\hat{k}, E)=2 \pi \int d^{3} q d E^{\prime} \frac{d \Omega^{\prime}}{4 \pi} N_{0}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}\right)[v( q )]^{2} \delta^{3}\left( k _{F}- k _{F}^{\prime}- q \right) \\\times\left[1-f_{\sigma}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}, E^{\prime}\right)\right]\left\{\delta\left(E-E^{\prime}-\omega_{q}\right)[1+N( q )]\right. \\\left.+\delta\left(E-E^{\prime}+\omega_{q}\right) N(- q )\right\}\end{array}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{r}\Sigma_{\sigma}&lt;(\hat{k}, E)=2 \pi \int d^{3} q d E^{\prime} \frac{d \Omega^{\prime}}{4 \pi} N_{0}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}\right)[v( q )]^{2} \delta^{3}\left( k _{F}- k _{F}^{\prime}+ q \right) \\\times f_{\sigma}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}, E^{\prime}\right)\left\{\delta\left(E-E^{\prime}+\omega_{q}\right)[1+N( q )]\right. \\\left.+\delta\left(E-E^{\prime}-\omega_{ q }\right) N(- q )\right\}\end{array}\]</span> The self-energy is <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{r}\Sigma_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)= O \int{d^{3} q d E^{\prime} \frac{d \Omega^{\prime}}{4 \pi} N_{0}[v(q)]^{2} \delta^{3}\left( k _{F}- k _{F}^{\prime}- q \right)} \\\times\left\{\frac{f_{\sigma}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}, E^{\prime}+\omega_{ q }\right)-f_{\sigma}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}, E^{\prime}-\omega_{ q }\right)}{E-E^{\prime}}\right\}\end{array}\]</span> Terms proportional to <span class="math inline">\(N( q )\)</span> do not appear in (40) because these terms are proportional to <span class="math display">\[O \int d E^{\prime}\left(E-E^{\prime}\right)^{-1}\]</span> which vanishes.</p><p>If we now finally collect all our results, the transport equations for the quasiparticle distribution function <span class="math inline">\(N( q )\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> become <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}&amp;\left[1-\frac{\partial \Sigma_{\sigma}(\hat{k} E)}{\partial E}\right] \frac{\partial f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial \Sigma_{\sigma}(\hat{k} E)}{\partial t} \frac{\partial f_{\sigma}(\hat{k} E)}{\partial E}+\left(\nabla_{ k _{F}} \epsilon_{ k _{F}}\right) \cdot \nabla_{ r } f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E) \\=&amp;--2 \pi \int d^{3} q \frac{d \Omega^{\prime}}{4 \pi} d E^{\prime} N_{0}[v( q )]^{2} \delta^{3}\left( k _{F}- k _{F}^{\prime}- q \right) \\&amp;\times\left\{\delta\left(E-E^{\prime}-\omega_{q}\right)\left([1+N( q )] f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)\left[1-f_{\sigma}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}, E^{\prime}\right)\right]-N(q)\left[1-f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)\right] f_{\sigma}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}, E^{\prime}\right)\right)\right.\\&amp;\left.+\delta\left(E-E^{\prime}+\omega_{ q }\right)\left([N(- q )] f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)\left[1-f_{\sigma}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}, E^{\prime}\right)\right]-[1+N(-q)] f_{\sigma}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}, E^{\prime}\right)\left[1-f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)\right]\right)\right\}\end{aligned}\]</span></p><p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}&amp;\left[(\partial / \partial t)+\nabla_{ q } \omega_{ q } \cdot \nabla_{ r }\right] N( q ) \\=&amp;-(2 \pi)^{4} \sum_{\sigma} \int \frac{d \Omega}{4 \pi} \frac{d \Omega^{\prime}}{4 \pi} N_{0}(\hat{k}) N_{0}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}\right)[v( q )]^{2} \delta^{3}\left( k _{F}- k _{F}^{\prime}- q \right)\\&amp;\times\left\{N( q )\left[1-f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)\right] f \sigma\left( k ^{\prime}, E-\omega_{ q }\right)-[1+N( q )] f_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E)\left[1-f_{\sigma}\left(\hat{k}^{\prime}, E-\omega_{ q }\right)\right]\right\}\end{aligned}\]</span> Equations (41) and (42) represent one form of our basic transport equations.

(41) and (42) as the energyspace or <span class="math inline">\((E\)</span> -space <span class="math inline">\()\)</span> form of the transport equations. This form does not look like the Landau equations for a Fermi liquid because Landau works with the momentum variable <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(E .\)</span> In this section, we shall find equations which look similar to Landau's by transforming from <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> space into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> space.</p><p>In order to transform into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> space, we begin with a definition of the quasiparticle energy of the Landau theory <span class="math display">\[E_{\sigma}( k ; r , t)=\epsilon_{ k }+\Sigma_{\sigma}(E( k ; r , t), \hat{k} ; r , t)\]</span> We can define a new variable <span class="math display">\[\epsilon_{\sigma}(\hat{k}, E ; r , t)=E_{\sigma}-\Sigma_{\sigma}(E, \hat{k} ; r , t)\]</span> which can be used as a basic variable instead of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. This variable clearly has the significance of the local kinetic energy of a quasiparticle with total energy <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</p><p>For the remainder of this section, we assume that for each <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }\)</span> there exists a unique <span class="math inline">\(E( k ; r , t)\)</span> which solves Eq. (43). This uniqueness is known to fail in several cases of interest. <span class="math inline">\({ }^{13}\)</span> A k-space distribution function can be defined as <span class="math display">\[n_{\sigma}( k ; r , t)=\left.f_{\sigma}(E, \hat{k} ; r , t)\right|_{E=E( k , r , t)}\]</span> The transport equations can now be transformed into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> space. However, from (43) <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}d E_{\sigma}( k ; r , t)=Z_{\sigma}( k ; r , t)\times\left[d \epsilon_{ k }+\left.d \Sigma_{\sigma}(E, \hat{k} ; r , t)\right|_{E=E_{\sigma}( k , r , t)}\right]\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d \Sigma\)</span> is to be computed at fixed <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math display">\[Z_{\sigma}( k ; r , t)=\left[1-\left.\frac{\partial \Sigma_{\sigma}}{\partial E}(E, \hat{k} ; r , t)\right|_{E=E_{\sigma}(k, r , t)}\right]^{-1}\]</span> This <span class="math inline">\(Z(k)\)</span> is called the wave function renormalization constant. From (46) it follows that <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l}\nabla_{ r } E( k )=Z( k )\left[\nabla_{ r } \Sigma( k , E)\right]_{E=E( k )} \\\frac{\partial}{\partial t} E( k )=Z( k )[(\partial / \partial t) \Sigma(\hat{k}, E)]_{E=E( k )} \\\nabla_{ k } E( k )=Z( k ) \nabla_{ k } \epsilon_{ k }\end{array}\]</span> The last relation follows because <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{ k } \Sigma(\hat{k}, E)\)</span> is negligibly small. Equations (48) may be used to rewrite the transport equations, since <span class="math display">\[d n( k )=[d f(\hat{k}, E)+(\partial f / \partial E)(\hat{k}, E) d E(\hat{k})]\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d f(\hat{k}, E)\)</span> is to be taken at fixed <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. After some algebra we discover that the electronic transport equation, Eq. (41), may be expressed in k space as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}&amp;\left[(\partial / \partial t)+\nabla_{ k } E( k ) \cdot \nabla_{ r }-\nabla_{ r } E( k ) \cdot \nabla_{ k }\right] n( k )\\=&amp;-Z( k )[ \Sigma^{&gt;}(\hat{k}, E( k )) n( k ) -\Sigma^{&lt;}(\hat{k}, E( k ))[1-n( k )]\end{aligned}\]</span> which is exactly the Landau form of the transport equation. Notice that we have not assumed that <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is small compared to <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{0}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\beta^{-1}\)</span> in the derivation of this equation. Therefore, we can conclude that the Landau transport equation is valid for all temperatures much lower than the degeneracy temperature. This is a much wider range of validity than we might have guessed a priori.</p><p>To complete the transformation into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> space, we rewrite <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{&gt;}, \Sigma^{&lt;}, \Pi^{&gt;},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Pi^{&lt;}\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -space variables.

The mode is overdamped and scattering is mainly in the forward direction. Such a mode appears at the quantum critical point for a electronic nematic phase transition, and in gauge theories for a U(1) spin liquid. It leads to a short fermion life-time, violating Landau's criterion for a Fermi liquid. In spite of this, transport can be described by a Boltzmann equation. We include momentum relaxation by umklapp scattering, supplemented by weak impurity scattering. We find that above a very low temperature which scales with <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q}^{3},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q}\)</span> is the minimum umklapp scattering vector, the resistivity is linear in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> with a coefficient which is independent of the amount of disorder. We compare the relaxation time approximation with an exact numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation. Surprisingly we find that unlike the resistivity, the Hall Coefficient strongly deviates from the relaxation time approximation and shows a strong reduction with increasing temperature.

(For a recent discussion with up to date references, see [1].)

It is therefore important to ask whether there is a microscopic model that gives rise to the low temperature linear in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> resistivity.</p><blockquote><p>给出微观模型：这个模型的谱函数(spectral function)是<span class="math inline">\(D(q, \omega)=\frac{q \omega}{\omega^{2}+\left(C q^{3}\right)^{2}}\)</span></p><p>这个谱函数对应到很多重要的模型</p><ul><li>铜基超导quantum critical point对应的模型的最可能候选对象</li><li>twisted bilayer graphene</li></ul><p>这个模型是“非费米液体”，因为自能 <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(\omega)\sim \omega^{2 / 3}\)</span></p></blockquote><p>In this paper we consider a model which assumes a two dimensional Fermi sea where the fermions with dispersion <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }\)</span> are being scattered by a critical bosonic mode with the propagator <span class="math inline">\(P(q, \omega)=1 /\left(C q^{2}-i \omega / q\right)\)</span> so that the spectral function <span class="math inline">\(D(q, \omega)=\operatorname{Im}[P(q, \omega)]\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[D(q, \omega)=\frac{q \omega}{\omega^{2}+\left(C q^{3}\right)^{2}} \tag{1}\]</span> To simplify notations, throughout this paper we measure energy, temperature or frequency in units of the nearest neighbor fermion hopping parameter <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and we set the lattice constant to be unity. The fermions are scattered by this mode with a coupling constant <span class="math inline">\(g .\)</span> Equation (1) has arisen in several contexts.</p><p>For example, this equation describes the critical fluctuations at a quantum critical point that separates a Fermi surface with four-fold symmetry to one with two-fold symmetry. This is sometimes called the <strong>electronic nematic phase transition</strong> or the <strong>Pomeranchuk instability</strong>. This model is considered to be one of the <strong>leading candidates</strong> for a quantum critical point in the Cuprates. Nematicity is also known to play a prominent role in the iron based superconductors.[4] It is also worth noting that nematicity, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -linear resistivity and van Hove singularity are ingredients that are showing up in twisted bilayer graphene as well. [5] Importantly, the singularity is for small momentum <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\([6-8]\)</span> This is very different from a charge or spin density wave or an antiferromagnetic instability, where the singularity occurs at a finite <span class="math inline">\(q .[9,10]\)</span></p><p>Another example is the scattering of fermionic spinons by <span class="math inline">\(U (1)\)</span> gauge fluctuations that arise in spin-charge separated models in certain quantum spin liquids. [11] This model has also been discussed in the composite fermion description of the half-filled Landau level. [12] The <span class="math inline">\(\omega / q\)</span> term in the propagator <span class="math inline">\(P(q, \omega)\)</span> comes from Landau damping of the mode by the Fermi sea. The mode is over-damped with <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> that scales as <span class="math inline">\(q^{3}\)</span>. This leads to a fermion self energy <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(\omega)\)</span> that goes in leading order as <span class="math inline">\(\omega^{2 / 3}\)</span>, thereby violating the Landau criterion for a well defined quasi-particle. [11] As a result, this model is considered to be an example of a <strong>non-Fermi liquid</strong>.</p><p>We have earlier suggested that this model gives rise to a transport scattering rate that goes as <span class="math inline">\(T^{4 / 3}\)</span>. [11] This was based on the assumption that the bosonic mode equilibrates to the lattice, but this assumption has been rightly criticized on the grounds that the total momentum is conserved in the scattering process and therefore there is no mechanism for relaxing the current. [7,8] Some form of momentum relaxation such as disorder or umklapp scattering needs to be introduced. Ref. [7] considered impurity scattering and concluded that the leading T dependent correction for a singly connected convex <span class="math inline">\(2 D\)</span> Fermi surface has a power greater than 2 and saturate for higher temperatures. In ref. [8],the problem was worked out for several versions of disorder including a linear coupling to the nematic order parameter. In this paper we focus on umklapp scattering as the mechanism of momentum relaxation. The motivation is the following. In the Cuprates, the Fermi level is close to a van Hove singularity so that the minimum umklapp vector <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q}\)</span> connecting neighboring Fermi surfaces is small near the antinode, as seen in fig 1. Due to the <span class="math inline">\(q^{3}\)</span> scaling in Eq. <span class="math inline">\(1,\)</span> the temperature scale when the umklapp scattering kicks in can be very low, being proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q}^{3}\)</span> It will be interesting to find out what the resistivity is above this low temperature scale. A more general remark is that because the mode is overdamped, the umklapp effect is not exponentially small at low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> as in the case of electron-phonon interaction, but will in general be power-law down to the lowest temperature. As we shall show, what we find is a <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> behavior that crosses over to <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> at a very low temperature scale. To see how this come about, we make a quick estimate of the scattering rate <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span> of a fermion at the umklapp point <span class="math inline">\((\theta=0)\)</span> with energy <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> by emitting a boson mode with momentum <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> to reach a final state at <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> on the umklapp Fermi surface, a seen in the inset of Fig. 1 <span class="math display">\[\tilde{\gamma} \approx \int_{0}^{\infty} d \omega \int d \phi\left(n_{0}(\omega)+1\right) D(q, \omega) \approx T \int_{0}^{T} d \omega \int d \phi \frac{q}{\omega^{2}+\left(C q^{3}\right)^{2}}\]</span></p><p>In the second step we replaced the Bose factor <span class="math inline">\(n_{0}(\omega)+1\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(T / \omega\)</span> and the integration limit by <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(T&gt;C \Delta_{q}^{3},\)</span> we can first perform the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> integration by extending the upper limit to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. The integrand is now <span class="math inline">\(1 / q^{2}\)</span>. We approximate <span class="math inline">\(q^{2} \approx \Delta_{q}^{2}+\left(k_{F} \phi\right)^{2},\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> integration gives a constant. This shows that the scattering rate is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(T / \Delta_{q} .\)</span> In the opposite case of <span class="math inline">\(T&lt;C \Delta_{q}^{3}\)</span> it is easy to see that the upper limit of the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> integral gives an additional factor of <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> leading to a <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> behavior. As mentioned earlier, unlike the electron-phonon problem, the scattering rate is never exponentially activated. A more accurate calculation shown later gives the same result. It is worth remarking than since umklapp scattering involves a final state that carries current in the opposite direction, there is no significant distinction between a transport lifetime which is sensitive to the momentum relaxation of each collision and the collision time, in contrast to the case of forward scattering. [11] On the other hand, since the scattering is concentrated at certain points on the Fermi surface, in order to calculate transport properties it is necessary to determine how the momentum distribution relaxes in the vicinity of these points. We need to solve the Boltzmann equation using the scattering processes as input. This is done in the following sections.</p><p>We will calculate the resisitivity, magneto-resisitivty, Hall conductivity and the Hall constant <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span>. The key physics is that the important scattering process is concentrated near the antinodal point. As such, there is a lot of overlap in the mathematical framework with a different problem involving scattering by antiferromagnetic fluctuations at momentum <span class="math inline">\((\pi, \pi)\)</span> where strong scattering are concentrated at hot spots. [9] This problem was thoroughly investigated by Rosch [10] and his work was very helpful to us. In particular he found a linear T resistivity and linear B magnetoresistivity in certain parameter range. Just as in his case, we found that while some impurity scattering is needed to restrict the modification of the distribution function to the vicinity of a special point on the Fermi surface, the coefficient of the linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> term is independent of disorder. In this paper we focus on the relatively low temperature regime where the impurity scattering rate is comparable to the inelastic scattering rate, ie. when the temperature dependent part of the resistivity is comparable to the zero temperature limit. We defer discussion of the high temperature limit, or the clean limit, to a later paper.</p><h3 id="玻尔兹曼方程">2玻尔兹曼方程</h3><p>The reader may worry whether one can use a Boltzmann equation when there are no quasi-particles in the Landau sense. The answer is that the Boltzmann equation can be derived without assuming the existence of quasi-particles, as long as the self energy depends on <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> and not on momentum. ( In our problem the leading self energy correction depends only on <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>. While a small <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> dependence was discovered in a higher order expansion [13], we do not expect this to affect the argument in a significant way.) The above- mentioned result was shown in a classic paper by Prange and Kadanoff.[14] Their motivation was that in the electron-phonon scattering problem at temperature high compared with the Deybe temperature, the self-energy is <span class="math inline">\(\pi \lambda \omega\)</span> which can be larger than <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> and yet the Boltzmann equation was used routinely. We have adopted their method to the composite fermion problem [15] and here we sketch the main idea. The key observation by Prange and Kadanoff is that the electron spectral function takes the form <span class="math display">\[A( k , \omega)=\frac{\Sigma^{\prime \prime}(\omega)}{\left(\omega-\epsilon_{ k }-\Sigma^{\prime}(\omega)\right)^{2}+\Sigma^{\prime \prime}(\omega)^{2}}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{\prime}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{\prime \prime}\)</span> are the real and imaginary part of the self energy. For <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{\prime \prime}(\omega) \sim \omega^{2 / 3}\)</span> the spectral function is indeed very broad as a function of <span class="math inline">\(\omega,\)</span> but at a given small <span class="math inline">\(\omega,\)</span> it is actually a sharp function of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{k}-\mu .\)</span> This distinction is a familiar one in the modern ARPES literature, where the energy dispersion curve (EDC) is broad and the momentum dispersion curve (MDC) is sharp. The conventional derivation of the Boltzmann equation starting from the nonequilibrium Green's function involves integrating over <span class="math inline">\(\omega .\)</span> What Prange and Kadanoff proposed to do is to pick a patch of the Fermi surface specified by <span class="math inline">\(k(\theta)\)</span> which defines a contour along the Fermi surface parametrized by the direction <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> of the Fermi momentum vector and integrate the perpendicular momentum and hence over <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{k}\)</span> instead. As a result, instead of the usual distribution function <span class="math inline">\(f( k )\)</span> they introduced the function <span class="math inline">\(f(k(\theta), \omega) .\)</span> Note that in the usual formulation, the vector <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is decomposed into <span class="math inline">\(k(\theta)\)</span> and the momentum in the perpendicular direction, which is then represented by <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{k}-\mu .\)</span> Thus we can simply write down the standard Boltzmann equation with the understanding that in the momentum <span class="math inline">\(k ,\)</span> the component perpendicular to the Fermi surface is replaced by <span class="math inline">\(\left(\epsilon_{k}-\mu\right) / v_{F}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left(\epsilon_{k}-\mu\right)\)</span> is in turn is replaced by <span class="math inline">\(\omega .\)</span> We next introduce in the standard way the linear perturbation from the equilibrium by writing <span class="math inline">\(f( k )=f_{0}\left(\epsilon_{ k }\right)-\left(d f_{0}\left(\epsilon_{ k }\right) / d \epsilon_{ k }\right) \tilde{\Phi}( k )=f_{ k }^{0}+f_{ k }^{0}\left(1-f_{ k }^{0}\right) \tilde{\Phi}( k ) / T\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f_{0}\left(\epsilon_{ k }\right)=f_{ k }^{0}\)</span> is the Fermi distribution and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( k )\)</span> has the interpretation of a local shift of the chemical potential at patch <span class="math inline">\(\theta .\)</span> This leads to the linearized Boltzmann equation [7]: <span class="math display">\[\left(e v _{ k } \cdot E +e\left( v _{ k } \times B \right) \cdot \partial_{ k } \tilde{\Phi}\right) \frac{\partial f_{0}\left(\epsilon_{ k }\right)}{\partial \epsilon_{ k }}=-I_{e e}-I_{e i}\]</span> where the electron-electron collision term is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}I_{e e}=&amp; \sum_{ p , q , G } 2\left(g^{2} / T\right)\left|P\left( q , \epsilon_{ k }-\epsilon_{ k - q }\right)\right|^{2}[\tilde{\Phi}( k )+\tilde{\Phi}( p )-\tilde{\Phi}( k - q + G )-\tilde{\Phi}( p + q )] \\&amp; f_{ k }^{0} f_{ p }^{0}\left(1-f_{ k - q + G }^{0}\right)\left(1-f_{ p + q }^{0}\right) \delta\left(\epsilon_{ k }+\epsilon_{ p }-\epsilon_{ k - q + G }-\epsilon_{ p + q }\right)\end{aligned}\]</span> where G denotes a set of reciprocal lattice vectors and the electron-impurity collision term is <span class="math inline">\(I_{e i}=-\gamma_{0} \tilde{\Phi}( k )\left(d f_{0}\left(\epsilon_{ k }\right) / d \epsilon_{ k }\right)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{0}\)</span> is the impurity scattering rate. Note that we have described the scattering process as a electron-electron scattering via the exchange of the boson propagator <span class="math inline">\(D(q, \omega),\)</span> rather than the scattering between electrons via the emission and absorption of bosons. The reason is that the conservation of total momentum for the normal scattering <span class="math inline">\(( G =0)\)</span> is clearly seen in Eq. <span class="math inline">\(5 .\)</span> The distribution will rapidly equilibrate to a Fermi function with a shifted overall momentum <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( k ) \propto k . E\)</span> so that its contribution to the collision integral is exactly zero. Had we considered the emission and absorption of bosons, we would have to keep track of the shifted boson distribution function as well, which introduces more complications. Next, we will show that the vanishing of the normal collision term is more general. As long as the scattering is predominantly forward, then in order to conserve momentum and energy, the scattering partner <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> must be approximately equal to either <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(- k\)</span>. In the first case the last two terms in [] in Eq 5 cancel the first two terms to first order in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. In the second case, since <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}(- k )=-\tilde{\Phi}( k ),\)</span> the first two terms in [] in Eq 5 approximately cancel. A similarly argument applies for the next two terms corresponding to the outgoing pair <span class="math inline">\(p + q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k - q .\)</span> In the presence of impurity scattering which ensures that <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( k )\)</span> is smoothly varying, these arguments show that the contribution from normal scattering to the collision integral is negligible. This argument works also in the presence of a magnetic field. The Fermi surface is shifted along an axis that is rotate from the direction of the applied field <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> but the relation <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}(- k )=-\tilde{\Phi}( k )\)</span> continues to hold. So from this point on we will keep only the umklapp term <span class="math inline">\(( G \neq 0)\)</span> in Eq. <span class="math inline">\(5 .\)</span> On the other hand, in the clean limit, it is necessary to keep the normal scattering because the small residual terms left over from the approximate cancellation control the local equilibration and slow diffusion of the the disturbance of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( k )\)</span> along the Fermi surface towards the umklapp points. This is beyond the treatment of the current paper and is the reason why the results of this paper are limited to relatively low temperatures.</p><p>Our next step is to integrate out <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and the radial part of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> taking advantage of the fact that <span class="math inline">\(d f_{0}(\omega) / d \omega\)</span> ) is a sharply peaked function. To be concrete we choose the origin in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> space so that it is completely enclosed by the Fermi surface and we parametrize the Fermi surface by the angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> as shown in Fig <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> Leaving details to the Appendix, we find <span class="math display">\[e v _{F}(\theta) \cdot E +e\left( v _{F}(\theta) \times B \right) \cdot \frac{\partial \Phi(\theta)}{k_{F} \partial \theta}=\int \frac{d \theta^{\prime}}{2 \pi} 2 g^{2} \nu\left(\theta^{\prime}\right) F\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right)\left(\Phi(\theta)-\Phi\left(\theta^{\prime}\right)\right)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\nu(\theta)=k_{F} /\left(2 \pi v_{F}\right)\)</span> is the density of states factor at angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta .\)</span> In this equation, all variables are defined on the Fermi surface as parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)\)</span> is defined as <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}(k(\theta), \omega=0) .\)</span> The kernel of the integral equation <span class="math inline">\(F\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right)\)</span> depends on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{\prime}\)</span> only via the magnitude of the momentum transfer <span class="math inline">\(q\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right)\)</span> which connects the points <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{\prime}\)</span> on the umklapp Fermi surface as shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> Here we focus on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> near zero, and the discussion should be repeated for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> close to the other three nearest neighbor umklapp Fermi surfaces.

Note that after integration out the scattering partner, the Boltzmann equation now takes the form of umklapp scattering by emission and absorption of the mode defined by <span class="math inline">\(D(q, \omega)\)</span>. The kernel can be written in the form <span class="math inline">\(F\left(\theta, \theta^{\prime}\right)=2 q f(a)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a=C q^{3} / T\)</span> and the scaling function <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[f(a)=\int_{0}^{\infty} d x \frac{e^{x}}{\left(e^{x}-1\right)^{2}} \frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+a^{2}}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f(a)=\pi / 2 a\)</span> for small <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{2} / 3 a^{2}\)</span> for large <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.

The current is mainly carried by nodal electrons and current is no longer controlled by the distribution function near the umklapp points. A similar situation was pointed out by Hlubina et al [9] in connection with the hot-spot problem. Just as in that case, [10] the situation is different once a small amount of impurity scattering is introduced, with scattering rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{0} \ll 1\)</span>.

We conclude that the resistivity begins as a constant <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{0}\)</span> plus a <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> term which quickly changes to a linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> dependence, and then crosses over to a limited region of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{T}\)</span> behavior for <span class="math inline">\(T&gt;\Delta_{q} \gamma_{0} / \alpha\)</span> before the limit set by <span class="math inline">\(\left(\rho(T)-\rho_{0}\right) / \rho_{0}&lt;1\)</span> is reached. Note that the coefficient of the linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> term in the resistivity <span class="math inline">\(\rho(T)\)</span> itself is independent of the impurity scattering rate <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{0}\)</span> and is therefore intrinsic. It depends weakly on <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{q}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(1 / \sqrt{\Delta_{q}}\)</span>. At even higher temperatures, the assumption of the conductivity being dominated by small <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> no longer holds and the resistivity increases faster than linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p><p>We next solve the Boltzmann equation numerically without making the relaxation time approximation. This is done by discretizing the <span class="math inline">\(\theta^{\prime}\)</span> variable in Eq. 6 and converting the integral-differential equation (in the presence of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> ) by a matrix equation. Inverting the matrix numerically gives an accurate solution for <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta) .\)</span> The results for the resistivity are shown in Fig <span class="math inline">\(2 .\)</span> We introduce the dimensionless umklapp vector measured in units of the Brillouin zone size <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=\Delta_{q} / 2 \pi .\)</span> We also re-write <span class="math inline">\(C \Delta_{q}^{3}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{C}\left(\Delta_{q} / k_{F 0}\right)^{3}\)</span> and in the numerical calculations we set <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{C}=C k_{F 0}^{3}=1\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k_{F 0}\)</span> is the Fermi wavevector along <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0 .\)</span> We also set <span class="math inline">\(g=1\)</span> which simply sets the scale of the temperature dependent part of the conductivity. For the band dispersion <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }\)</span> we use the parametrization suggested by Horio et al. [16] for <span class="math inline">\(Nd\)</span> doped <span class="math inline">\(LSCO , t^{\prime} / t=-0.136, t^{\prime \prime} / t=0.068\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t^{\prime}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t^{\prime \prime}\)</span> are the further neighbor hopping integrals. This model has a van Hove singularity at doping <span class="math inline">\(p \approx 0.22\)</span> beyond which the large hole Fermi surface centered at <span class="math inline">\((\pi, \pi)\)</span> becomes an electron Fermi surface centered at zero. Near this doping the dimensionless umklapp vector <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is very small. In Fig. 2 we see that the relaxation time approximation works very well at low temperature, but lies above the exact results and deviates from linearity sooner as temperature increases. The linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> behavior is very clear at low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> from the inset of Fig 2 a. For <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=0.066\)</span> the initial <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> term is hardly visible, but becomes apparent for the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=0.105\)</span> case, as expected from the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{3}\)</span> dependence of the crossover scale. We verify that the resistivity slope is independent of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{0}\)</span> by inspecting Fig <span class="math inline">\(2 .\)</span> The cross-over to <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{T}\)</span> is rather subtle and can be seen as a region of convex curvature in the inset of Fig. 2a. Numerically the linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> like regime extends to about <span class="math inline">\(2 \rho_{0}\)</span>.</p><p>In Fig 3 a we show <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)\)</span> for a range of temperatures for a finite impurity concentration. At zero temperature, <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)\)</span> is given by the relaxation time approximation due to impurity scattering alone and the dips at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> are due to the smaller Fermi velocity there. In the inset, we see that at low temperature, the <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is further suppressed mainly near the umklapp points at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> so that the current is reduced in a way that is linear in T. As the temperature further increases. the current is increasingly being carried by fermions away from the umklapp points. This is responsible for the eventual deviation from linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in the resistivity. We also show Fig <span class="math inline">\(3 b\)</span> the distribution function <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{0}(\theta)\)</span> in the relaxation time approximation. We see that the relaxation time approximation works very well at low temperature, but tends to over-estimate the effect of temperature as <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> increases, leading to the upward curvature for the resistivity shown by the red lines in Fig.2.</p><h3 id="磁场依赖和实验关系">4 磁场依赖和实验关系</h3><p>We next discuss the effect of an orbital magnetic field, and compute the Hall effect and magnetoresistance. Our model contains a number of features which have been seen experimentally in a number of Cuprates. Here we show some useful comparisons and also point out a number of inadequacies of our model.</p><p>The Hall coefficient <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> is calculated from the linear <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> coefficient in the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation and shown by the blue lines in fig. <span class="math inline">\(4 .\)</span> For comparison we also show the relaxation time approximation result, using the standard Zener-Jones formula. [17] <span class="math display">\[\sigma_{x y}=\frac{2 e^{3} B}{h} \int \frac{d \theta}{2 \pi} \frac{v_{y}}{\gamma(\theta)} \frac{d\left(v_{x} / \gamma(\theta)\right)}{d \theta}\]</span> The two results agree exactly at zero temperature where impurity scattering dominates, but to our surprise they deviate strongly at higher temperatures. The zero temperature value is a bit lower than the expected <span class="math inline">\(1 /(1+p) .\)</span> This is because we assume a constant scattering rate as appropriate for Born scattering. If we assume a constant mean-free path as is appropriate for impurities with a fixed scattering cross-section, we do find <span class="math inline">\(1 /(1+p) .\)</span> This difference is as expected in the presence of anisotropic Fermi velocities. [17] At finite temperatures our model has inelastic scattering rate which strongly depends on the position on the Fermi surface, being large near the umklapp point. At a given <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> its temperature changes from linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> moves away from the umklapp point, as seen from Eq. <span class="math inline">\(10 .\)</span> This kind of anisotropic scattering has been used as phenomenological models with considerable success to fit the conductivity and the angle dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR) for the Tl based and other cuprates. [18, 19] They assume an isotropic Fermi liquid like <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> term and a non-Fermi liquid <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> term that is concentrated near the anti-node. This kind of model bears a lot of similarity to the relaxation time approximation of our more microscopic model. Therefor the resistivity results are similar. Their calculated Hall coefficient also shows a weak temperature dependence, consistent with the red curves in Fig.4. However, we see that the relaxation time approximation fares poorly for the Hall coefficient, which we find to decrease strongly with increasing temperature. As we can see by comparing Fig. 4 a and b, the decrease is faster and the discrepancy is stronger for smaller <span class="math inline">\(\Delta .\)</span> This result suggests the following physical picture. Consider an electron near <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\pm \pi / 2\)</span> in the presence of an <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> field along <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The umklapp process scatters the electron to a final state on the Fermi surface in the neighboring Brillouin zone in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> direction. This is equivalent to near perfect back scattering and the final state has a y component of the Fermi velocity that is opposite in sign to that from a near forward scattering process. This can lead to a reduction and eventually a sign change in the Hall effect as the temperature increases. The information about the final state is encoded in the <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\left(\theta^{\prime}\right)\)</span> term on the right hand side of Eq. 6 but is absent in the relaxation time approximation. To confirm this picture we have calculated <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> in a model where the umklapp scattering to the neighboring Fermi surfaces located in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> direction have been removed, leaving only two umklapp points along the electric field direction. As seen from Fig. 5 the Hall coefficient is now increasing with <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and is qualitatively similar to the relaxation time approximation result.</p><p>Experimentally <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> that decreases with increasing temperatures was observed in underdoped and optimally doped YBCO in the early days of high <span class="math inline">\(T_{c}\)</span> research and considered to be a major puzzle. [20,21] It has never been explained by any theory based on the relaxation time approximation and inspired exotic suggestions such as two different lifetimes for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y} \cdot[22]\)</span> The fact that a strongly temperature dependent <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> shows up due to the breakdown of the relaxation time approximation may give a hint to this long standing puzzle. We should caution that in the experiment <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> is well fitted to a <span class="math inline">\(1 / T\)</span> form while our results in Fig. 4 is closer to a linearly decreasing function. Furthermore, this behavior is seen most strongly in the underdoped Cuprates, where <span class="math inline">\(1 / R_{H} \approx p\)</span>. This is a feature of the pseudogap which is not captured in our present model, which gives in the limit of low temperature <span class="math inline">\(1 / R_{H} \approx 1+p\)</span>.</p><p>We also computed the Hall conductivity <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y}\)</span> and the magneto-resistivity <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{x x}\)</span> as shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(6 .\)</span> The magneto-resistivity is initially quadratic in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as expected, by switches over to a linear dependence. However, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y}\)</span> also deviates from linear <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> at a similar <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> scale. This indicates a breakdown of the weak field condition <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{c} \tau&lt;1\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hbar \omega_{c}=e B / m\)</span>. In a tight binding model we can roughly set <span class="math inline">\(m \approx 1 / 2 t\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(B \approx \hbar \omega_{c} / 2 t\)</span> which gives us a sense of the size of the dimensionless parameter <span class="math inline">\(B .\)</span> For an accessible field of tens of Tesla's, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is indeed of order <span class="math inline">\(10^{-2}\)</span> as shown in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(4 .\)</span> It has been pointed out that a linear <span class="math inline">\(|B|\)</span> magneto-resistance can happen when a group of carriers is moved by the magnetic field to round a corner at <span class="math inline">\(\theta=\pm \pi / 2,\)</span> where the x component of the Fermi velocity changes sign. This can be a striking effect when the curvature of the turning point is large.[23] A linear magneto-resistance is also found in a parameter range associated with linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> resistivity by Rosch <span class="math inline">\([10] .\)</span> However, it is not known whether <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x y}\)</span> also deviates from linearity in these cases. Experimentally linear <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> magneto-resistance have been found to be associated with the low temperature linear <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> behavior in both the Cuprates [3,24] and the iron based superconductors <span class="math inline">\([25] .\)</span> It is often (but not always [24] ) fitted to the form <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{B^{2}+T^{2}}\)</span>. However, this is observed in the <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{c} \tau&lt;1\)</span> regime and it is not clear if our theory applies. Recent experiments even indicate that the linear in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> magneto-resistance may have a Zeeman rather than orbital origin. [3] The effect of a magnetic field on the distribution <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is shown in fig. <span class="math inline">\(7 .\)</span> We can see the distribution being shifted to the right, but its magnitude also becomes asymmetric as the field is increased. Note that the condition that <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> is an odd function of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is violated by the magnetic field, and the argument given earlier in support of the relaxation time approximation fails.</p><h3 id="结论">5 结论</h3><p>We have treated a model of fermions scattered by a critical bosonic mode with umklapp scattering being the dominant momentum relaxation mechanism. After introducing a weak impurity scattering, we find that above a very low temperature scale, the resistivity is linear in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. We find that the resistivity is charaterized by a highly anisotropic scattering rate, which is linear in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> near the umklapp points and becoming <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> as we move away from the umklapp point. It should be noted this is happening in a model where inverse life-time of the fermion is large, proportional to <span class="math inline">\(T^{2 / 3}\)</span> and Landau's criterion for Fermi liquid is violated. Thus the lifetime of the electron as measured by ARPES is totally different from that inferred from transport measurements. We also find a serious breakdown of the relaxation time approximation in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a Hall coefficient <span class="math inline">\(R_{H}\)</span> that decreases with increasing temperature. This is a unique feature (or signature) of transport that is dominated by umklapp scattering. While many of these features have be seen in Cuprates, we should caution that our model has made a specific assumption that the boson mode is completely soft, i.e. we are either at the quantum critical point or in a critical phase. Deviation from critically will give a low temperature cut-off of the phenomena we describe. We should also remember that the model assumes a sharp fermi surface in the sense that the electron spectral function is sharp in momentum space at low energy, i. e. the MDC as seen in ARPES is well defined. Thus our model does not have the pseudogap at the antinode, which is a dominant feature in underdoped Cupartes. Recently it was shown that the MDC becomes sharp abruptly for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> greater than a certain <span class="math inline">\(p_{c}[26]\)</span> and our model may be better suited for this doping range.</p><h3 id="附录">附录</h3><p>We sketch the derivation of Eq. 6 starting from Eqs. 4 and <span class="math inline">\(5 .\)</span> The idea is to integrate out the variable <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and replace it with the fermion susceptibility. In the case of umklapp scattering, we expect <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to be far from the umklapp points, so that <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( p )\)</span> is slowly varying and we can drop the term <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( p )-\tilde{\Phi}( p + q )\)</span> on the right hand side for small <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. We also replace <span class="math inline">\(\delta\left(\epsilon_{ k }+\epsilon_{ p }-\epsilon_{ k - q + G }-\epsilon_{ p + q }\right)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\int d \omega \delta\left(\epsilon_{ k }-\epsilon_{ k - q + G }-\omega\right) \delta\left(\omega+\epsilon_{ p }-\epsilon_{ p + q }\right) .\)</span> We replace the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> integration by an integration along the Fermi surface and one perpendicular to it. For simplicity we shall assume a quadratic dispersion. The radial integration is replaced by an integral over <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ p } / v_{F} .\)</span> This integration can be done using the identity <span class="math display">\[\int d \epsilon f_{0}(\epsilon-\omega)\left(1-f_{0}(\epsilon)\right)=\omega\left(1+n_{0}(\omega)\right)\]</span> The appearance of the Bose factor on the right signals that we are describing a particle-hole excitation which has Bose statistics. Next we do the integration along the Fermi surface which we can replace by <span class="math inline">\(k_{F} d \theta_{p}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{p}\)</span> specifies a patch on the Fermi surface. For small <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> we can write <span class="math inline">\(\delta\left(\omega+\epsilon_{ p }-\epsilon_{ p + q }\right)=\delta\left(v_{ p } \cdot q -\omega\right) .\)</span> We choose the origin of <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{p}\)</span> to be the point where <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is tangent to the Fermi surface. The delta function then becomes <span class="math inline">\(\delta\left(v_{F} q \sin \left(\theta_{p}\right)-\omega\right) .\)</span> Doing the <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{p}\)</span> integration gives the factor <span class="math inline">\(\omega / v_{F} q\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\omega&lt;v_{F} q,\)</span> as expected for Landau damping. We obtain <span class="math display">\[I_{e e}=\left(g^{2} / \pi T\right) \sum_{ q } \delta\left(\epsilon_{ k }-\epsilon_{ k - q + G }-\omega\right)\left(n_{0}(\omega)+1\right) f_{ k }^{0}\left(1-f_{ k - q + G }^{0}\right)\left(k_{F} \omega / v_{F} q\right)|D(q, \omega)|^{2}[\tilde{\Phi}( k )-\tilde{\Phi}( k - q + G )]\]</span> Finally we integrate Eq. 4 over <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }\)</span> The lefts side gives the left side of Eq <span class="math inline">\(6 .\)</span> On the right side the fermi factors force <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }-\mu\)</span> to be small and we can replace <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\Phi}( k )\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(\theta)\)</span> as defined in the text. The integration over <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k }\)</span> is done by using Eq. 13 again, and we obtain Eq. 6 .</p>]]></content>

We present evidences that the network constructs local correlations in the early stage and learns large-scale structures in the latter stage. We believe this two-stage training dynamics is universal and is applicable to a wide range of problems. Our work <strong>builds bridges</strong> between two research subjects of quantum neural networks and information scrambling, which opens up a new perspective to understand quantum neural networks.</p><h4 id="measurement-driven-phase-transition-within-a-volume-law-entangled-phase">Measurement-Driven Phase Transition within a Volume-Law Entangled Phase</h4><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03052.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Measurement-Driven Phase Transition within a Volume-Law Entangled Phase</a></p><p>We identify a phase transition between two kinds of volume-law entangled phases in non-local but few-body unitary dynamics with local projective measurements.</p><ol type="1"><li>In one phase, a finite fraction of the system belongs to a fully-entangled state, one for which no subsystem is in a pure state,</li><li>while in the second phase, the steady-state is a product state over extensively many, finite subsystems.</li></ol><p>We study this "separability" transition in a family of solvable models in which we <strong>analytically determine the transition point</strong>, the evolution of certain entanglement properties of interest, and relate this to a mean-field percolation transition. since the entanglement entropy density does not distinguish these phases, we introduce the <strong>entangling power</strong> (which measures whether local measurements outside of two finite subsystems can boost their mutual information) as an <strong>order parameter</strong>, after considering its behavior in tensor network states, and numerically studying its behavior in a model of Clifford dynamics with measurements.</p><p>We argue that in our models, the separability transition coincides with a transition in the computational "hardness" of classically determining the output probability distribution for the steady-state in a certain basis of product states.

The simplest non-Abelian anyon involves a defect that binds a Majorana zeroenergy mode. predicted to appear quite naturally in certain superconducting systems. I will review recent progress in the Majorana search, and the challenges in the validation of Majorana devices. Later I will introduce a simple measurement scheme to overcome the problem, and show robust, clear, and universal experimental signatures of Majorana zero modes. I will also discuss a serious type of errors in general topological quantum computation and Majorana qubit. Diabatic corrections only vanish as a power-law function with the length of time for the braid. This power-law behavior can wash out the advantages of topological quantum computation. We found that such diabatic errors can be detected and corrected by applying a sequence of parity measurements.</p></blockquote><ul><li>基本概念介绍</li></ul><ol type="1"><li>拓扑量子计算</li><li>Majorana零能模</li></ol><ul><li>Majorana量子器件中的一些问题</li></ul><ol type="1"><li>Majorana零模的实验探测-进展</li><li>量子器件中的问题-杂质效应</li><li>量子器件的特征方程</li></ol><ul><li>拓扑量子计算中的基本问题</li></ul><ol type="1"><li>辨子操作中的非绝热问题</li><li>简化的量子纠错</li></ol><ul><li>展望未来</li></ul><p class="note note-primary">What is next?</p><h3 id="基本概念">1.1 基本概念</h3><p>量子计算的优势：指数信息存储和量子并行加速</p><p>核心：维持多个量子比将的</p><ol type="1"><li>量子态叠加</li><li>量子纠缠</li></ol><p>问题和挑战</p><ol type="1"><li>量子门误差</li><li>量子退相干</li></ol><p>解决方案</p><ol type="1"><li>纠错：物理量子比特 构建 逻辑量子比特（问题是调控非常复杂）example Small Surface Code with 49 Qubits</li><li>传统量子计算之外：拓扑量子计算</li></ol><p>拓扑量子计算</p><ul><li>Kitaev, 1997 Kitaev模型</li><li>非阿贝尔任意子（非局域）构建 <strong>量子比特</strong> （弱退相干）</li><li>任意子的编织构建 <strong>量子逻辑门</strong> （高容错）</li></ul><p class="note note-danger">哪里能找列Majorana零能模</p><p>系统需要满足的条件</p><ol type="1"><li>Zero energy bound state</li><li>Majorana operator <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=\gamma^{+}\)</span></li></ol><p>Usually quasi-particles carry charge： Particle <span class="math inline">\(c^{\dagger} \neq c\)</span> hole</p><p>所以我们需要一个<code>电荷中性</code>的系统——比如说超导</p><ol type="1"><li><span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{E \uparrow}=\int d x\left[u_{E}(x) \psi_{\uparrow}^{\dagger}(x)+v_{E}(x) \psi_{\downarrow}(x)\right]\)</span> s-wave SC quasi-particles carry different spin</li><li>It is impossible to have <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{E}^{\dagger}=\gamma_{E}\)</span></li><li><span class="math inline">\(\bar{\gamma}_{E}=\int d x\left[u_{E}(x) \psi^{\dagger}(x)+v_{E}(x) \psi(x)\right]\)</span> Unconventional spinless SC 去掉自旋</li><li>Arrange <span class="math inline">\(u_{E}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_{E} \Rightarrow \gamma_{E}^{\dagger}=\gamma_{E}\)</span></li></ol><h3 id="majorana量子器件中的一些问题">1.2 Majorana量子器件中的一些问题</h3><p>Majorana 的 实验探索手段</p><ol type="1"><li>Andreev reflection</li><li>Majorana resonance <span class="math inline">\(G=G_{0}=\frac{2 e^{2}}{h}\)</span> <span class="label label-primary">Ref Law, Lee & Ng , PRL (2009)</span></li><li>Resonant Level <span class="math inline">\(\frac{G}{G_{0}}=\frac{4 \Gamma_{L} \Gamma_{R}}{\left(\Gamma_{L}+\Gamma_{R}\right)^{2}}\)</span></li></ol><p>实验1：Mourik, et al.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[TOC]</p><h2 id="动力学量子相变简介">1 动力学量子相变简介</h2><h4 id="相变">相变</h4><p>相变是物理学中的重要概念，物质发生热力学相变通常意味着在温度到达 某个临界温度 <span class="math inline">\(T_{c}\)</span> 时，它的性质发生了剧烈的变化，如水在0摄氏度时变成冰。</p><p>而量子相变通常是指发生在零温，由某个参数驱动导致系统基态发生的剧烈变 化，如量子伊辛模型中铁磁和顺磁的转变 ;</p><p>量子相变中还有一类叫拓扑相变， 此时系统的拓扑性质发生剧烈的改变，如KT相变和整数量子霍尔效应。</p><p><img

class="math inline">\(H\left(\lambda_{i}\right)\)</span> 的基态, 其中 <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> 是一个<strong>可调的参数</strong>，事实上我们就是通过突然的改变这个参数，让系统进行淬火动力学演化，演化的哈密顿量为 <span class="math inline">\(H\left(\lambda_{f}\right),\)</span> 系统的波函数可以写为 <span class="math display">\[\left|\phi(t) \right\rangle   =e^{-i H\left(\lambda_{f}\right) t} | \phi_{i}\rangle_{\circ}\]</span> 我们定义Loschmidt振幅为 <span class="math display">\[G(t)=\langle\phi(t)\left|\phi_{0}\rangle=\langle\phi_{0}\right| e^{-i H\left(\lambda_{f}\right) t} \mid \phi_{0}\rangle\]</span> 波函数的交叠。在形式它非常类似于系统的配分函数 <span class="math inline">\(Z=\operatorname{Tr}\left(e^{-\beta H}\right)_{\circ} \quad\)</span> 仿照自由能密度 <span class="math inline">\(f(T)\)</span> 的定义，我们定义淬火过程中的动力学<strong>自由能密度</strong> <span class="math display">\[g(t)=-\lim _{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N} \log G(t)\]</span> 我们知道对于由温度 <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> 驱动的热力学相变，自由能密度 <span class="math inline">\(f(T)\)</span> 或者 它的某一阶导数在相变点 <span class="math inline">\(T_{c}\)</span> 出现非解析的行为，如图所示</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20201029110742809.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><p>我们期待在淬火 动力学过程中也存在由时间 <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> 驱动的相变，当系统含时演化到某临界时间 <span class="math inline">\(t_{c}\)</span> 时， 动力学自由能密度或者它的某阶导数出现非解析行为，我们称之为<strong>动力学量子相变</strong>。</p><h4 id="复平面延拓">复平面延拓</h4><p>为了进一步了解动力学相变, 我们将Loschmidt振幅延拓到复平面 <span class="math inline">\(t \rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(t+i \tau\)</span> <span class="math display">\[G(z)=\langle\phi_{0}\left|e^{-i H\left(\lambda_{f}\right) z}\right| \phi_{0}\rangle\]</span></p><ol type="1"><li>当系统自由度N很大时, Loschmidt 振幅满足大偏差标度行为</li></ol><p><span class="math display">\[G(z)=e^{-N g(z)}\]</span></p><p>其中动力学自由能 <span class="math inline">\(g(z)\)</span> 在热力学极限下有良好的定义。</p><ol start="2" type="1"><li>在有限尺寸下，<span class="math inline">\(G(z)\)</span> 是 <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> 的解析函数， 将它作维尔斯特拉斯展开</li></ol><p><span class="math display">\[G(z)=e^{\mu z} \prod_{j}\left(z_{j}-z\right)\]</span></p><p>其中 <span class="math inline">\(\mu(z)\)</span> 始终是解析函数</p><p>如图所示</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20201029141530100.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><ul><li>有限尺寸下它的零点 <span class="math inline">\(z_{j}\)</span> 是复平面中一些孤立的点，, 它们不可能与时间轴相交，</li><li>然而在热力学极限下，这些孤立 的零点组成了连续的曲线或平面区域，它与时间轴的交点（橘黄色的点）正是配分函数的零点，在这些时刻系统将发生动力学量子相变。</li></ul><p>实际上，这种做法与费舍尔将配分函数中的温度延拓虚温度得到的费舍尔零点， 或者李政道和杨振宁将磁场延拓到虚磁场得到的李-杨零点在思想上 是一致的。</p><p>尽管动力学量子相变是在横场伊辛模型中<strong>被发现</strong>，但是随着研究的深入， 人们发现动力学相变是<strong>非常普遍存在</strong>的，如在</p><ol type="1"><li>XY模型</li><li>XXZ模型</li><li>费米Hubbard模型</li><li>拓扑能带系统</li></ol><h4 id="临界现象与标度行为">临界现象与标度行为</h4><blockquote><p>连续相变的一个重要的特征就是在相变点存在临界现象与标度行为</p></blockquote><p>以横场伊辛模型为例，系统哈密顿量为 <span class="math display">\[H(h)=\sum_{m}^{N-1} \sigma_{m}^{z} \sigma_{m+1}^{z}-h \sum_{m}^{N} \sigma_{m}^{x}\]</span></p><ul><li><p>当 <span class="math inline">\(h / J&gt;1\)</span> 时， 基态处在顺磁相;</p></li><li><p>当 <span class="math inline">\(h / J&lt;1\)</span> 时，基态处在铁磁相。</p></li></ul><p>将系统的初态取为 $J=0 $ 的基态 ，淬火后的哈密顿量取为 <span class="math inline">\(h=0\)</span> 。通过实空间<strong>重整化群变换</strong>的计算发现在复时间平面内<strong>不动点</strong>为</p><ol type="1"><li>$K^{*}=0 $ （无穷高温）</li><li><span class="math inline">\(K^{*}=\infty\)</span> (零温)</li><li><span class="math inline">\(K^{*}=i n \pi\)</span></li></ol><p>动力学相变发生的时刻为 <span class="math inline">\(K_{c}=\frac{(2 n+1) \pi}{4},\)</span> 经过两次重整化群变换, 它到达了伊辛模型零温的不稳定不动点 <span class="math inline">\(K_{c} \rightarrow K^{*}=\infty,\)</span> 这表明动力学相变也具有<strong>标度</strong>和普适性。计算标度方程可以得到 <span class="math display">\[\operatorname{Re}[g(t)] \sim\left|\frac{t-t_{c}}{t_{c}}\right|\]</span> 许多一维的量子系统都具有这种形式的标度行为。不过对于二维系统，标度行为要丰富很多。例如Chern 绝缘体满足时律的非解析行为，而二维伊辛模型 则是对数形式非解析行为。</p><h4 id="动力学相变与平衡态相变的比较">动力学相变与平衡态相变的比较</h4><p>我们知道对于一个在零温发生的量子相变，在有限温度时它将以相变点 <span class="math

<span class="math inline">\(H_{i}\)</span> 的基态，由于我们计算的是 <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> 时刻波函数与 初始波函数的交叠，这相当于我们在零能量密度（按照初始哈密顿量）时的动力学，如果我们考虑它在有限能量密度的演化，一个有意义的问题是是否存在<strong>类似临界区域?</strong></p><blockquote><p>这个问题<strong>没有一般的答案</strong>，仅对于有长程相互作用的伊辛模型， 实验上发现这个临界区域存在 。</p></blockquote><p>另外一个重要的问题是动力学相变能否用朗道的对称性破缺理论来描述？</p><p>这个问题目前<strong>还没有答案</strong>，在动力学相变中我们也无法有效的定义动力学序参 量。仅有一种<strong>特殊类型例外</strong>，那就是动力学拓扑相变, 利用Loschmidt 振幅 的相位可以得到它的动力学拓扑序参量为Pancharatnam相。</p><h4 id="动力学量子相变的实验实现">动力学量子相变的实验实现</h4><p>动力学量子相变提出三年后,P. Jurcevic等人利用原子模拟技术首次观测到有长程相互作用的横场伊辛模型中的量子相变。他们用 <span class="math inline">\(^{40} Ca ^{+}\)</span> 的两个 态 <span class="math inline">\(\mid S_{\frac{1}{2}}, m \rangle\)</span> 和 <span class="math

<span class="math display">\[E_{2}-E_{1}=\hbar \omega\]</span> 爱因斯坦在 1916-1917 年接受这一思想并加以发展，引入爱因斯坦系数，在量子范畴内对光的吸收率辐射率加以说明。在同一篇文章中, 伟大的爱因斯坦提出了受激辐射过程，这是激光科学的基础。</p><p><img

。</p><p>不过很快人们就意识到，在多个原子存在的情况下，光子屏蔽效应会很快<strong>衰减掉</strong>。即在一个腔中存在多个二能级系统时, 光子屏蔽效应将不再明显。不过好在 Rebic 证明，在腔中放入单个的二能级原子，系统的光子屏蔽效应会非常明显。</p><h5 id="bose-hubbard模型">Bose-Hubbard模型</h5><p>我们研究的对象与

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>文小刚教授的一些文字摘录</p></blockquote><h3 id="实在性与抽象">实在性与抽象</h3><p>什么是真实？如果一个物理世界中可以测量的只有线性响应，那在这个世界线性响应就代表着所有的事实，物理理论就将是线性响应的理论，在我们的世界里，我们可以测量的事物当然不只是线性响应，但是似乎可测量的也不比线性相应多多少，我们可以测量的其实只是关联函数，这使我们不禁很想用关联函数来定义世界上的物理理论，关联函数可能就代表着我们世界的真实。</p><p>这一点之所以重要是因为物理理论中的很多概念并不代表真实，一旦新的理论发展起来，这些概念就可能改变。例如，具有位置和速度的点粒子是牛顿经典理论的基本概念，其理论大厦的建筑砖块，我们过去相信所有事物都由粒子组成，粒子是真实的基础，我们现在相信粒子不代表真实，相反，线性希尔伯特空间中的量子态代表真实。但是，量子态不是我们可以直接测量的事物，有朝一日超越量子理论的新理论发展出来，谁也不能保证量子态概念不会有粒子概念相同的命运。（希望读者同意我的观点：现有的物理理论无一根本正确并代表终极真理）</p><p>物理学是一门测量的科学，不幸的是物理理论常常包含许多不代表真实的内容（例如牛顿经典力学中粒子的概念）。同一真实可能用完全不同的理论去描述，甚至可能基于根本不同的概念。因此透过理论中的形式和非真实概念的烟幕，密切注视真实（如关联函数和可观测量）是非常重要的。把这一思路推向极端，我们可以认为量子态和量子算符也不代表真实。它们只不过是用于计算可以为实验所测量的关联函数的数学工具。</p><h3 id="自信从哪来">自信从哪来？</h3><p>很多人会担心，在领域的边缘或几个领域的交界处做研究会脱离主流，使自己变成小众，做的东西没人理会，所以做创新研究要有足够的自信。有时自己的理论要花八年十年才被接受，没有足够的自信，研究就无法做下去。</p><blockquote><p>自信从哪来？</p></blockquote><p>自信来源于自己的价值观、自己的审美观和自己的好奇心。做自己认为有价值的东西、自己认为美的东西，不管别人怎么看，也能继续做下去。如果自己很好奇，所研究的东西有意思到放不下，那就做下去，没有必要关心自己的理论被不被接受，只要自己欣赏就行了。当然自己做的工作，也会热心地向别人推荐，希望别人能和自己一起欣赏这里的美。这大概是做创新工作的一种心态。</p><h3 id="文小刚忆安德森">文小刚忆安德森</h3><p>他只是讲了各种各样的迹象和思路使他相信一定有 SU(2) 规范场。结果我听得一头雾水。几个月后有两篇文章出来，从形式上论证了量子磁性材料中真的可以有 SU(2) 规范场。</p><p>这次经历对我触动很大。 很显然，安德森对规范场的数学并不精通，可是他对规范场物理本质的理解是如此的深刻。<strong>我自认为花了两年时间，学了两遍量子场论，对规范场应该很熟悉，可还是完全听不懂安德森对规范场的物理洞察。</strong>这使我意识到量子场论中对规范场的介绍并没有触及到规范场的本质。寻求对规范场本质的理解，正是我发展拓扑序理论的原动力。</p><p>我在普林斯顿高等研究院做博士后时，听过安德森给高年级研究生讲的凝聚态物理课。<strong>他讲的东西常常在形式上是错的，数学也是错的，可是在这些有数学错误、逻辑不通的描述背后，隐含着深刻的物理精华</strong>，要把这些精华听出来很不容易。这反映了在物理的前沿，我们想要描述的东西常常是超出了现在已有的数学工具，所以我们只好用这些不合适的数学语言，来试图描写我们想要说的东西。<strong>这代表最前沿的物理研究和思想方法：在没有找到合适数学语言的情况下，如何推进物理研究。</strong></p><h3 id="enlightened">enlightened</h3><p>1989年，我提出拓扑序这一概念的时候，量子计算这一领域还没怎么形成。当时只知道拓扑序在宏观上描写了一种新的量子物态，但拓扑序的微观起源并不是很清楚。直到2002年，我系统地研究量子自旋液体的时候，突然意识到拓扑序的起源应该是量子纠缠。这一发现使我有了一种升华（enlightened）的感觉。可当时我对量子纠缠只是一知半解。于是此后我就跨界进入量子信息领域，努力学习量子纠缠。</p><p>直到2010年我才和陈谐、顾正澄合作提出了长程量子纠缠的概念，搞清楚长程量子纠缠是拓扑序的微观起源。也就是说拓扑序不是别的，正是多体系统中量子纠缠的不同长程构型。研究拓扑序，就是研究多体系统中的长程量子纠缠。从宏观上提出拓扑序这一概念，到对其微观起源的发现花了20多年。</p><h3 id="参考文献">参考文献</h3><ol type="1"><li><p>文小刚《量子多体理论》</p></li><li><p><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/KZYYT_hUJF1WEdj9RoboGQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">跨界科研的优势</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ceNHLUrpu-CMsOI7SbQnrw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">文小刚院士忆安德森：他是20世纪凝聚态物理的一面旗帜</a></p></li><li></li></ol>]]></content>

有直接的关系。而 Binnig 等人在设计 STM 之初就期 望通过这个隧穿电流获得样品表面具有空间分新的态密度信息。为此，他们建立了把样 品与针尖分开考虑的隧穿模型，并且引入了隧穿矩阵 M： <span class="math display">\[M=\frac{\hbar}{2 m} \int_{z}\left(\chi^{*} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial

这个结果说明在 STM 当中样品与针尖的地位是对称的，我们所测得的隧穿电流是 由样品性质与针尖性质共同决定的。</p><ul><li>态密度近似</li></ul><p>为了利用隧穿电流直接获得样品的态密度信息，我 们就需要对针尖做一些调控，使其轨道成为一个 s 波轨道，在测量范围内态密度几乎不 变，这样隧穿电流变为： <span class="math

\rho_{T}^{\downarrow}\left(E_{F}\right)\right]\]</span> 可以看出，利用一根自旋极化 (spin-polarized, SP) 的 STM 针尖 <span class="math inline">\(\left(\rho_{s}^{\uparrow}\left(E_{F}\right) \neq \rho_{s}^{\downarrow}\left(E_{F}\right)\right)\)</span>, 隧道电流还能够反映样品表面的自旋分布情况。考虑极端情况 <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{s}^{\uparrow}\left(E_{F}\right) \ll \rho_{s}^{\downarrow}\left(E_{F}\right),\)</span> 公式可改写为： <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}I &amp;\propto e V\left[\rho_{s}^{\uparrow}\left(E_{F}\right) \rho_{T}^{\uparrow}\left(E_{F}\right)+\rho_{s}^{\downarrow}\left(E_{F}\right) \rho_{T}^{\downarrow}\left(E_{F}\right)\right]\\&amp; \propto e V \rho_{s}^{\uparrow}\left(E_{F}\right) \rho_{T}^{\uparrow}\left(E_{F}\right)\end{aligned}\]</span> 对于样品表面两个电子自旋分布不同的位置，隧穿电流就会因为样品表面自旋向上 电子的态密度区别产生对比度，反映在图像上。对（公式2-15）求电压的导数，就能够 获得该位置自旋 LDOS。因此，SP-STM 即能够探测样品表面实空间的磁结构，又能够 探测 LDOS

针尖的位移一般 在 Å 量级，为了获得高精度的可控位移，一般使用压电陶瓷 (piezoceramic) 作为 位移单元。压电陶瓷具有压电效应，在外加电场时会发形变。这种形变具有很高 的精度，能够满足 STM 的要求。需要注意的是，压电陶瓷随电压变化的形变量 与所处温度相关。STM 扫描头通常需要在不同温度下工作，如室温 300 K、液氮 温度 78 K 或者液氦温度 4.2 K 其至更低。在不同工作温度之间转换时，需要调 整相应压电陶瓷的响应系数（定标）以及控制电压的大小。</p><h4 id="隧穿电流放大电路与扫描控制电路">隧穿电流放大电路与扫描控制电路</h4><p>STM 控制器在样品和针尖之间外加一个电压，从而产生隧穿电流。这个隧穿电 流的大小一般在 nA 量级，需要经过一个放大电路将微弱的电流信号放大用于后 期处理。在获得样品形貌信息时，STM 有两种工作模式：恒流模式与恒高模式。 恒流模式，也是最为常见的工作模式，在整个扫描过程中保持隧穿电流的大小不 变。当样品表面高度发生变化，利用减法器将隧穿电流的变化传输到扫描管的控 制电路上，控制扫描管伸缩使得隧穿电流的大小变回最初的参考值。与此同时，中。 隧穿电流的变化会被记录下来，经过计算转换成样品表面的高度变化反映在显示器上。这个电路被称作反贵电路。恒高模式则不需要反贵回路，直接记录隧穿电 流的大小并转化为样品形貌高度。这种模式的优点在于扫描速度快，但是缺点也 很明显：由于没有反贵回路，样品与针尖之间的距离不可控，在扫面过程中针尖 可能会与样品接触导致损坏。由于针尖是 STM 系统中最为脆弱的部分，因此恒 高模式一般很少使用。</p><h4 id="锁相放大器">锁相放大器</h4><p>在 STS 测量过程中，样品与针尖距离一般保持不变（关闭反贵回路），随后改变 偏压以获得样品不同能量下的 LDOS。由于 LDOS 正比于微分电导<span class="math inline">\(\frac{d I}{d V} \propto \rho_{s}\left(E_{F}-e V\right)\)</span> , 因此需要对获得的隧穿电流求导。数值求导这个方法往往会因为隧穿电流中混入噪音导致效果不佳，因此通常都利用一个锁相放大器 (lock-in amplifier) 直接获得 微分电导 <span class="math inline">\(d I / d V 。\)</span> 锁相放大器会在样品与针尖之间的电压信号 <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> 中加入一个小 的交流分量 <span class="math inline">\(V_{l o c k-i n}=\Delta V_{s} \sin (\omega t),\)</span> 此时将隧穿电流关于这个小量 <span class="math inline">\(V_{l o c k-i n}\)</span> 进行泰勒展开： <span class="math display">\[I\left(V+V_{l o c k-i n}\right)=I(V)+\left.\frac{\partial I(V)}{\partial V}\right|_{V} \Delta V_{s} \sin (\omega t)+o\left(\Delta V_{s}\right)^{2}\]</span> 利用锁相原理，可以直接获得频率为 <span class="math inline">\(\sin (\omega t)\)</span> 的交流相 <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial I(V)}{\partial V}\)</span> 的值，也就是微分电 导。交流信号的频率可以选取的很高 ( 1000Hz)，从而避开其他频率的噪音影 响，获得高质量的微分电导信号。此外，利用锁相放大器，还可以在形貌扫描的同 时直接获得当前扫描能量下的 LDOS 空间分布 (<span class="math inline">\(dI / d V\)</span> mapping)。LDOS 的空间分 布可以用于探测样品表面的准粒子态，如量子磁通温旋、MZM 等。此外，若样品 表面存在由杂质或是缺陷产生的能带间的准粒子干涉（quasiparticle interference, QPI)，采集到的<span class="math inline">\(dI / d V\)</span> mapping 在做傅里叶变换之后就能够得到这些散射波的波</p><h4 id="减振系统">减振系统：</h4><p>由于隧道电流对针尖与样品间的距离非常敏感，要保证这个距离可控，整个系统 必须尽可能隔绝外界振动。通常的做法是将于扫描头连接的整个 UHV 腔体放在个气动防振台上。此外，STM 扫描头又可以通过一些弹簧悬挂在腔体内部。通 过这两个不同本征频率的阻尼，扫描头处就能够最大程度屏蔽外界产生的振动。 当然，实验过程中整个腔体周围环境要尽一切可能保持无干扰，因此 STM 最好 的工作时间就是在夜深人静的午夜。</p><h4 id="针尖">针尖：</h4><p>针尖是 STM 中最为关键的部件。由于隧道电流由针尖与样品的态密度共同决定， 因此如何得到一个合适的针尖是 STM 实验的重中之重，也是初学者的 STM101 课程。一般来说，STM 使用金属材料钓 (W) 或者锦袭合金 (PtIr) 制作针尖。这两 种材料都比较情性，不容易与其他元素反应，因此是制作一根稳定针尖的首选。 W 针尖可以通过电化学腐蚀法得到，但是在 UHV 腔外制作完成后表面一般会有 层绝缘氧化层，需要在 UHV 腔内用电子束轰击加热至 1200 K 以上去除氧化层 才能获得一个干净的针尖。W 比较硬，即使使用中轻触样品表面也不会损坏，本 身造价也十分低廉，因此被广泛使用。PtIr 针尖一般通过机械加工方法获得（如 剪切法等），PtIr 合金更为稳定，但质地比较软，价格也比较昂贵。除了这两种针尖以外，应对不同的测量需求，还会用到其它针尖。例如：在 SP-STM 中需要使 用针尖在不同自旋取向有不同的态密度。常用的方法是在 W 针尖表面蒸渡磁性 原子薄膜。蒸渡铁 (Fe) 会在 W 针尖顶端形成铁磁性薄膜，而蒸渡锋 (Cr) 则能在 针尖表面形成反铁磁性薄膜。使用超导材料制作的针尖则常被用于超导样品的测 量，形成超导-绝缘体-超导结 (superconductor-insulator-superconductor junction, SIS junction)。通常利用超导金属妮作为针尖材料，也能够利用 W 针尖通过受控碰撞 在超导样品表面吸起一块超导材料原位制作超导针尖。</p><p>对于用于形貌测量的针尖，通常会出现双针尖或者多针尖的问题，也就是针尖顶 端有多个原子在进行隧穿，因此获得的图像会有重影，高度也存在错位。对于用 于 STS 测量的针尖，则会出现针尖电子态比较特殊，不满足在 s 波轨道条件，因此获得的态密度包含了针尖电子轨道的信息，无法将样品本征性质与之分离。利 用针尖和样品的对称性，我们可以准备一些形貌或者 LDOS 谱已知的标准样品 (如银单晶、银岛薄膜等) 用来检测并修饰针尖，使其达到我们所需的状态。这一 过程被称为修针尖。通常的操作手段有：在针尖与样品间加比较高的偏压，利用 电子带动针尖表面原子重新排布，在针尖顶端获得一个比锐利的形状，用于形貌 测量;在一些金属表面轻微碰撞，裹上一层金属原子（例如银）从而获得一个接 近 s 波轨道的针尖用于 STS 测量。一根锐利的针尖能够获得很好的形貌分辨率， 却通常处于不确定的电子轨道，不能用于 STS 测量; 一根 s 波轨道的针尖能够准 确的测出样品 LDOS，针尖端点却一般比较圆注，不能获得高分辨的形貌图像。 因此在修针尖时要有针对性的对针尖进行处理，获得自己需要的针尖状态。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[TOC]</p><h2 id="摘要">摘要</h2><p>低维关联量子物态是当前凝聚态物理的研究热点，其非平庸拓扑信息很大程度上隐藏在基态波函数的量子纠缠特性中。 <span class="math display">\[拓扑 \leftrightarrows 纠缠\]</span> 通过将体系一个子部分的约化密度矩阵取对数得到的纠细哈密顿量，以及其本征值谱、即纠细谱，则是定量描述纠细的工具。通过左右划分得到的边缘纠细谱的低能部分与拓扑态边缘激发能谱一一对应，从而可以反映拓扑信息。</p><p>本文集中于一维有对称性的短程纠缠态、</p><ul><li>即对称性保护拓扑态(SPT态)</li><li>通过研究其共振价键固体(VBS)</li></ul><p>构型的严格 可解点基态波函数的量子纠缠特性，来刻画SPT态的拓扑性质。主要内容如下。</p><h4 id="第一部分">第一部分</h4><p>在第一部分我们首先介绍了反铁磁整数自旋链的Haldane相，以及作为其严格可解点的AKLT模型。我们说明只有奇数自旋AKLT态才属于非平庸的SPT态，并以该模型为例证明，SPT态边缘纠缠谱简并度中，既有拓扑相关的部分、也有非普适的部分，而非平庸的前者可通过由对称性决定的拓扑退纠缠算符除去。该工作厘清了SPT态边缘纠缠细谱的结构，对用纠缠谱刻画拓扑态有指导作用。</p><h4 id="第二部分">第二部分</h4><p>从第二部分起，我们研究如何通过量子纠缠，从VBS型基态波函数中读取原SPT态与平庸相之间的量子临界点的信息。该临界点不能用朗道的经典理论描述，其低能元激发是原VBS的边缘自由度。我们对VBS波函数引入对称的延展划分：将每l个格点组合成 一个了块，以所有奇数了块作为了系统，得到体纠缠细哈密顿量<span class="math inline">\(H_{E}\)</span>。我们说明，<span class="math inline">\(H_{E}\)</span> 在 <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> 选取合适的情况下就描述退禁闭的边缘自由度之间的渗透，从而给出量子临界点的完整能谱。我们证明自旋S-AKLT 态的<span class="math inline">\(H_{E}\)</span>是自旋 <span class="math inline">\(S / 2\)</span> 的海森堡模型，对于非平庸的奇数 $S $ 并取 <span class="math inline">\(l=\)</span>偶数，<span class="math inline">\(H_{E}\)</span>就描述Haldane相与平庸相之间的量子临界点，低能有效理论是<span class="math inline">\(S U(2)\)</span>,WZW场论。</p><h4 id="第三部分">第三部分</h4><p>在第三部分，我们将延展划分的方法运用到具有 <span class="math inline">\(SO (5)\)</span> 对称性的自旋2-VBS态，并证明<span class="math inline">\(H_{E}\)</span> 在 <span class="math inline">\(l=\)</span> 奇数 时就描述与原SPT 态相连的量子临界点，低能有效 理论是 <span class="math inline">\(S U(4)\)</span>, WZW场论。在第四部分，我们用自旋构造了具有 <span class="math inline">\(SU(N)(N \geq 3)\)</span> 结柄端边缘互为共斩，破坏镜像对称性; 而当总长度为奇数时，两端边缘相同，属于非平庸SPT 态，且其对应的量子临界点由取 <span class="math inline">\(l=\)</span>奇数的体纠缠哈密顿量描述，低能有效理论是 <span class="math inline">\(S U(N)\)</span>, WZW场论。</p><p>通过延展划分我们不仅可以得到量子临界点低能有效理论，更能写出对应的哈密顿量，从而建立了体-边缘-量子临界点对应，深化了对拓扑态的理解。</p><h2 id="以波函数为重心-一种新的研究范式">以波函数为重心: 一种新的研究范式</h2><h3 id="新旧">新旧</h3><h4 id="从还原论到演生论">从还原论到演生论</h4><ul><li>还原论的作用</li></ul><p>在物理学的历史中，还原论(Reductionism)一直是研究者的信仰。人们相信，一切复杂系统中出现的现象都可以还原到基本组成单元的行为上，只要我们透彻认识了最基本组成单元的运动规律，我们就可以以此为基础反方向推导所有系统的运动规律。以此信念为指导，人们对物质的认知从宏观物质深化到分子、原子、质子中子、夸克乃至于超弦，可以说，还原论在人类科学的发展历程中起了巨大的推进作用。</p><ul><li>还原论的局限</li></ul><p>但是，随着人们对复杂体系认识的深入，还原论越来越显得力不从心。这是因为，复杂体系的自由度数随着粒子数的增加而指数增长，很快就超出了数值计算的极限，让整个体系的行为预测变得不可能。</p><ul><li>演生(Emergence)</li></ul><p>20世纪中叶以来，人们认识到，物质世界根据能量尺度的不同可以划分为不同的层次，各个层次之内各有其运动的基本规律，这些基本规律作为本层次内的有效理论存在，而与别的能量尺度上的规律并无强烈关系。于是，不同层次的体系会展现出多样的物理现象，这些现象独立于组成部分的微观细节，也无法用组成单元本身的运动规律来预测，这就是演生(Emergence)现象。一个典型的例子就是连续相变的重 整化群理论，作为其基础的标度不变性只是在对应尺度上的有效理论，并不能由更基本粒子的运动规律推导出来。诺贝尔奖得主.W.Anderson对演生现象有一 句著名的概括: More is differen</p><h4 id="强关联">强关联</h4><p>现代凝聚态物理、尤其是强关联体系，由于其粒子数和粒子间的强关联大大增加了体系的复杂性，成为<strong>新奇</strong>宏观量子现象的<strong>频发地</strong>，典型的如</p><ul><li>量子霍尔效应</li><li>高温超导体</li></ul><p>人们在这些体系中观测到大量基本粒子中<strong>无法想象</strong>的<strong>新奇现象</strong>，比如</p><ul><li>电荷分数化</li><li>满足分数统计甚至非阿贝尔统计的任意子</li></ul><p>并由此开发出新的研究方法、并预言更新奇的量子现象。</p><p>这些发展除了有其深刻的理论意义，还具有潜在的巨大利用价值，比如利用任意子构造容错率极高的量子计算机 、发展性能更好的量子材料等。甚至有可能利用凝聚态体系中的演生现象，来解决基本粒子物理中由来已久的问题，比如Majorana费米子的存在性问题。因为这些原因，凝聚态物理成为当代物理学最蓬勃和兴盛的分支之一。</p><h4 id="相变理论的传统范式">相变理论的传统范式</h4><p>凝聚态物理的基本任务之一是刻画物态以及物态之间的转变。对于经典物态这个任务可以用朗道的对称性破缺理论很好地完成。</p><ul><li>传统范式的局限</li></ul><p>而对极低温接近量子极限下的物态，则更为复杂。一个典型的例子是分数量子霍尔效应，在每一个平台上的横向霍尔电阻都是数学精度的值，但是不同电阻平台上的态都具有相同的对称性，也不具有局域的序参量，这说明朗道理论在描述这些态的时候并不 足够，这些平台上的物态包含一种超出经典范畴的结构。</p><p>在传统的少体或者弱关联量子问题中，典型的研究方式是用平均场理论求解哈密顿量，再根据需要做微扰展开，但在分数量子霍尔效应以及现代凝聚态物理面对的一系列体系中，粒子间的关联程度如此强大以至于平均场理论失效，而热力学量级的自由度数又让求解哈密顿量成为不可能，于是提出一种新的研究范式(Paradigm)迫在眉捷。</p><h4 id="新研究范式的起源">新研究范式的起源</h4><blockquote><p>绕开哈密顿量，构造出有效的基态波函数，研究其中包含的物态信息。</p></blockquote><p>这种新研究范式的突破起源于Laughlin，他在解释分数量子霍尔效应实验的 时候，开创性地绕开哈密顿量，而直接写出了在不同霍尔电阻平台上的基态波函数，即著名的Laughlin 波函数。对于填充因子为 <span class="math inline">\(v=1 / m\)</span> 的平台，其基态波函数的形式为: <span class="math display">\[\Psi_{L}=\prod_{i&lt;j}\left(z_{i}-z_{j}\right)^{m} e^{-\sum_{i}\left|z_{i}\right|^{2} / 4}\]</span> 其中 <span class="math inline">\(z_{i}=x_{i}+i y_{i}\)</span> 是第i个粒子的坐标。在此波函数的基础上，Laughlin预言了这个态的边缘激发形式、和体激发满足的分数电荷性质，这些都在后来的实验中被验证，Laughlin也因此获得了1998年的诺贝尔物理学奖。</p><p>在此之后，人们意识到Laughlin的方法是一类有效的研究强关联量子物态的方法，即直接构造出有效的基态波函数，研究其中包含的物态信息，之后再根据需要构造以此波函数为基态的母哈密顿量(Parent Hamiltonian) 。在很多时候，尽管构造出的母哈密顿量与体系真实的哈密顿量有较大的不同，但是其基态波函数的性质却非常相似。鉴于在极低温的量子极限下，我们只关心低能部分的物理，所以这种研究范式是有效的。从此，对于强关联量子体系的研究重点，就转向了对各种具有非平庸结构的基态波函数的研究，并大大深化了人们对量子世界物质的理解。</p><h3 id="拓扑序的刻画纠缠">拓扑序的刻画：纠缠</h3><h4 id="非局域的拓扑序">非局域的拓扑序</h4><p>人们认识到，对于这类新奇量子物态，其波函数中通常并不存在局域的序参量，但是存在非平庸的量子序。这种序与体系的微观局域细节无关，而仅取决于体系的拓扑结构，因而在局域扰动下有稳定(Robust)的结构，并可以被反映在各种可观测性质中，比如体激发的分数统计性质、分数化的边缘激发等等。这种稳定的新型的序就被称为拓扑序，具有拓扑序的量子物质就被称为拓扑物态。至今为止，人们对于无能隙的拓扑物态理解还比较欠缺，但对于有能隙态已经有比较深刻的认识。</p><h4 id="纠缠态分类">纠缠态分类</h4><p>近年来，凝聚态物理学家逐渐认识到量子纠缠在刻画拓扑序的时候发挥着重要的作用，并根据纠缠特性的不同，有能隙拓扑物态可以分为长程纠缠 和短程纠缠两种。</p><blockquote><p>定义是，在封闭的空间中(如一维的周期性链和二维的Torus等)中，</p><ul><li>基态波函数的简并度大于1，则称其为长程纠缠态</li><li>反之则称为短程纠缠态。</li></ul></blockquote><p>根据对称性和量子纠缠特性，有能隙的拓扑态可以被分为四类，如表1.1所示。 <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{lcc}\hline &amp; \text { 短程纠缠 } &amp; \text { 长程纠缠 } \\\hline \text { 有对称性 } &amp; \text { SPT 态 } &amp; \text { SET 态 } \\\text { 无对称性 } &amp; \text { 平庸态 } &amp; \text { LRE 态 } \\\hline\end{array}\]</span> 我们的研究集中在具有对称性的短程纠缠态、即对称性保护拓扑态(Symmetry-Protected-Topological Phase，以下简称SPT态)。</p><h4 id="spt对称性保护拓扑态">SPT对称性保护拓扑态</h4><blockquote><p>SPT“对称性 保护”定义：</p><p>所谓“对称性 保护”，物理上的体现为，在保证对称性的前提下，我们无法将一个SPT态绝 热地(Adiabatically) 转变为平庸的真空态，除非经历能隙的关闭过程。</p></blockquote><p>SPT态的基本特征是在边缘存在分数(Fractionalized) 的自由度，该自由度禁闭(Confined)在边缘附近，构成对称群的投影表示(Projective epresentation) <span class="math inline">\(^{[17]}\)</span></p><p>对于SPT态，人们认识到它大致可以分为以下几种：</p><ul><li>(1)玻色子体系，其拓扑分类由文小刚等人利用群上同调(Group Cohomology)理论给出[17]，典型例子是一维自旋模型中的Haldane相;</li><li>(2)无相互作用费米子，如近年引起广泛关注的拓扑绝缘体，其分类由Kitaev 和Ryu 等人给出 ;</li><li>(3)相互作用费米子体系（还不完备）。</li></ul><p>在本文中，我们研究一维系统中的SPT态，其典型的不动点(Fixed Point)构型是共振价键固体态(Valence-Bond-Solid State，以下简称VBS态)</p><h4 id="vbs态">VBS态</h4><p>如图所 示</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20200926233224736.png"

class="math inline">\(\rho_{A}\)</span> 中。我们引入的第一个量是纠缠熵，它被定义 为 <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{A}\)</span> 的von Neumann熵: <span class="math display">\[S=-\operatorname{Tr}\left(\rho_{A} \ln \rho_{A}\right)\]</span> 纠缠熵刻画了A、B部分之间纠缠程度的大小。</p><h4 id="面积定律">面积定律</h4><p>可以证明，对于有能隙的态，纠缠熵满足所谓面积定律: <span class="math display">\[S=\alpha L-\gamma\]</span> 其中</p><ul><li><span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>表示A、B部分之间接触面积的大小，对于一维体系接触面就是一个点，于是<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> =常数，</li><li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> 是一个与体系有关的系数，</li><li>而 <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> 是一个面积定律的修正项。可以 证明，对于短程纠细的态， <span class="math inline">\(\gamma=0,\)</span> 而对于长程纠细态 <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \neq 0,\)</span> 所以 <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> 被称为拓扑纠缠熵 (Topological Entanglement Entropy) <span class="math inline">\(^{[29,30]}\)</span></li></ul><h4 id="example">example：</h4><p>而对于一维的无能隙临界态，因为存在一类共形不变性(Conformal Invariance，它是标度不变性的一种推广)，利用共形场论的知识，可以证明，纠缠熵 满足如下Calabrese-Cardy公式 <span class="math display">\[S=\frac{c}{3} \ln \left[\frac{L}{\pi} \sin \left(\frac{\pi L_{A}}{L}\right)\right]+S_{0}\]</span> 其中</p><ul><li>$L $, <span class="math inline">\(L_{A}\)</span> 分别是总系统与A部分子系统的长度。这个公式在周期性边条件(PBC)下成立，在开放边条件下会有一定的修正。</li><li><span class="math

id="纠缠熵的不足">纠缠熵的不足</h4><p>纠缠熵在刻画拓扑序中发挥了重要的作用，但是它也有各种不足[33]。</p><ul><li>比如它的一般形式是基于标度理论给出的，在数值计算中难以达到很高的精确度。</li><li>最重要的是，纠缠熵只是一个数字，难以完全确定丰富的拓扑序。</li></ul><h3 id="纠缠谱">纠缠谱</h3><p>作为纠缠熵的深化和推广，在2008年，Haldane引入纠缠谱的概念。将约化密度矩阵写成如下形式: <span class="math display">\[\rho_{A}=e^{-H_{E}}\]</span> 其中</p><ul><li><span class="math inline">\(H_{E}\)</span> 被称为纠缠哈密顿量(Entanglement Hamiltonian)，它有类似于量子体系的 热力学哈密顿量的形式</li><li>纠缠谱就被定义为 <span class="math inline">\(H_{E}\)</span> 的能谱 <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\xi_{i}\right\}\)</span></li></ul><p>显然，纠缠熵就是纠缠哈密顿量的热力学熵(取纠缠温度$==1 $) ，而纠缠谱包含着更多的信息。</p><p>纠缠谱的方法一经提出，很快被利用到各种不同的体系中，如</p><ul><li>FQHE体系</li><li>自旋链体系</li><li>拓扑绝缘体和拓扑超导体体系</li><li>量子临界体系</li></ul><p>在特定的系统中，该方法的有效性也可以被解析地证明</p><h4 id="对应纠缠谱-拓扑边缘激发">对应：纠缠谱-拓扑边缘激发</h4><p>一个重要的观点是：我们在划分体系的时候相当于在A、B分界处产生了一条虚拟的边界，于是 <span class="math inline">\(H_{E}\)</span> 作为描述A部分的哈密顿量会包含有A部分边缘自由度的信息，于是，纠缠谱中很可能包含原体系边缘激发的信息，这也是Haldane最初引入纠缠谱时做的假设，即：拓扑态基态波函数纠缠谱的低能部分，与原拓扑体系的边缘激发能谱有一一对应的关系。</p><h4 id="如何划分">如何划分</h4><p>显然，纠缠谱的性质与我们如何划分体系有密切关系。至今为止，大致 显有四种不同种类的划分方式，</p><ul><li><ol type="1"><li>轨道空间的划分，这也是Haldane最早引入的划分方式;</li></ol></li><li><ol start="2" type="1"><li>粒子数空间划分，这样得到的纠塵谱在一定体系中可以得到体激发的信息</li></ol></li><li>(3)动量空间的划分，这在某些无能隙的临界体系中可以运 用<br /></li><li>(4)实空间的划分，这也是我们当前工作采用的划分方式。</li></ul><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20200927003903167.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><p>在前人的工作中，有两类实空间的划分被应用(见图 1.2，以一维为例):</p><ul><li><ol type="1"><li>将体系沿中间一分为二的划分，这样的划分可以得到单个边缘的激发能谱，我们称之为边缘纠缠谱(Edge Entanglement Spectrum);</li></ol></li><li>(2)将体系中截取一段的划分,对于有能隙态，这样得到的纠缠谱可以反映两个边缘自由度之间的相互作用形式，对于一维临界态，此时的纠缠谱可以确定普适类与临界指数，这种纠缠谱被称为块纠缠谱(Block Entanglement Spectrum)。</li></ul><p>在我们的工作中，我们将对于SPT态的VBS构型基态波函数引入第三种划 分，即延展性的划分(Extensive Bipartition)，如图 1.2(c)所示。容易看出，这样的划分可以产生一系列的边缘自由度，于是此时 <span class="math inline">\(H_{E}\)</span> 是一个描述边缘自由度在体中相互作用的哈密顿量，因而我们称此时的纠缠谱为体纠缠谱(Bulk Entanglement Spectrum)。我们认为，在取合适的子块长度下，体纠缠谱可以反映原SPT态与平庸态之间的量子临界点能谱。</p><p>在此之前，我们先介绍一种典型的、也是人们认识最为充分的强关联体 系SPT态，即一维反铁磁自旋链中的Haldane相(Haldane Phase)。</p><h2 id="haldane相-一种典型的spt">Haldane相: 一种典型的SPT</h2><h3 id="haldane相">Haldane相</h3><h4 id="反铁磁海森堡自旋模型">反铁磁海森堡自旋模型</h4><p>Haldane相产生于如下形式的反铁磁海森堡自旋模型中: <span class="math display">\[H=J \sum_{i} S _{i} \cdot S _{i+1}, \quad J&gt;0\]</span> 对于自旋1/2的情况，Bethe在1931年给出的严格解证明，其能谱无能隙，自旋-自旋关联函数在长距离情况下成审函数衰减。在之后的半个世纪里，人们认为该结论对任意自旋都定性成立。</p><p>直到1983年，Haldane利用自旋相干态路径积分推导低能有效场论的方法证明，在自旋S很大的情况下，</p><ul><li>当S为整数时，有效作用量是1+1维的O(3)非线性 <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> 模型，能谱有能隙;</li><li>而在自旋为半奇数的时候，作用量会在 <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> 模型的基础上增加一个拓扑项，受自旋1/2的严格解启发，Haldane认为该拓扑项的量子干涉作用会让整个能谱呈现无能隙状态。</li></ul><h4 id="haldane-猜想">Haldane 猜想</h4><p>Haldane的结论虽然是基于大S 极限情况给出的，但他猜测对小自旋情况也成立，这就是著名的Haldane 猜想 :</p><blockquote><p>Haldane 猜想：一维自旋S的反铁磁海森堡模型</p><ul><li>当S为半奇数时是无能隙的，自旋-自旋关联函数以幂函数形式衰减：</li><li>当S为整数时是有能隙的，自旋-自旋关联函数在长距离下指数衰减。</li></ul></blockquote><p>这一猜想的正确性在后来的实验和数值研究中得到证实。自此，整数自旋反铁磁链的有能隙相就被称为<strong>Haldane相</strong>。</p><h4 id="奇偶-haldane相">奇偶 Haldane相</h4><p>近年来，人们认识到整数自旋Haldane相可以进一步分成两类：</p><ol type="1"><li>奇数自旋的Haldane相受对称性保护，属于真正的非平庸SPT态，起保护作用的是以下任意一种或多种对称性：<ul><li>(1)时间反演对称性(Time Reversal

id="haldane相的区分标准">Haldane相的区分标准</h3><p>为了给这两类Haldane相提供一种可观测的区分标准，Pollmann等人提出，对于非平庸的奇数自旋情况，边缘纠缠谱的每个能级都是二重简并。为说明这个概念，考虑如下的自旋1哈密顿量: <span class="math display">\[H=J \sum_{i} S _{i} \cdot S _{i+1}+U_{z z} \sum_{i}\left(S_{i}^{z}\right)^{2}, \quad J&gt;0\]</span> 显 然， <span class="math inline">\(U_{z z} / J\)</span> 可 以 作 为 调 制 参 数 , 在 其 等 于0的 时 候 就 得 到Haldane相。Pollmann等人利用iTEBD的方法计算了在不同参数取值情况下的基态波函，并将该波函数沿中间分成左右两部分，计算边缘纠缠谱，他们的结果如图 所示。</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/medium" srcset="/img/loading.gif"

重简并度。进一步，他们将这一观点做了推广：</p><blockquote><p>任何基态波函数边缘纠缠谱貝有简并度的态都是拓扑非平庸的。</p></blockquote><p>但是，纠缠谱的简并度都能作为SPT态的标志吗？我们将在一维SPT 态的框架内深入探究这个问题，并厘清边缘纠缠谱中简并度的涵义。</p><h2 id="spt与平庸态之间的相变-超越朗道理论的量子临界点">SPT与平庸态之间的相变: 超越朗道理论的量子临界点</h2><h4 id="无能隙的未解之谜">无能隙的未解之谜</h4><p>在第一小节里我们已经提到，对于有能隙的拓扑物态人们已经有比较深刻 的理解，但对于无能隙的量子物态则较为欠缺。顾名思义，无能隙则意味着存在能量任意小的激发，那么体系为何能在扰动下稳定地存在，对于这一最基础的问题，人们仍然没有很好的理解。</p><ol type="1"><li>一种可能的假设是，d维无能隙的拓扑态都是某个d + 1维有能隙拓扑态的边缘态，那么该无能隙态的稳定性就由高一维的拓扑态稳定性所保证。</li><li>而另一种可能是，无能隙的拓扑态可以作为同一维度的有能隙拓扑态与平庸相(Trivial Phase，或称真空态)之间的量子临界点(Quantum Critical Point，以下简称QCP)存在，从而保证其稳定性。于是，研究拓扑物态与平庸相之间的量子临界点，就有了更重要的意义。</li></ol><h4 id="量子相变">量子相变</h4><p>正如SPT态的定义指出，在保持对称性的前提下，SPT与平庸态之间的转变必须经历能隙闭合的相变过程。可以证明，该相变一定是连续相变，从而是一个量子临界点。在相变点两侧的态具有一样的对称性，因而这个相变不能用朗道的对称性破缺理论来描述，它属于一类零温时的拓扑量子相变，其相变点被称为退禁闭(Deconfined)量子临界点。一个深刻而自然的问题由此产生:</p><blockquote><p>这个量子临界点的信息，是否也像边缘激发能谱一样，被隐含在SPT 态的基态波函数中？如果是，该如何读取这个信息？</p></blockquote><p>我们认为，拓扑态基态波函数就像这个态的DNA，所有的非平庸信息都被包括在内，包括量子临界点的信息。至于提取该信息的方法，首先注意到，SPT态与具有相同对称性的平庸态之间的区别在于，边缘自由度在前者中被禁闭，在后者中则退禁闭，并且作为临界点的低能元激发(Elementary Excitation)形式存在。于是，我们就需要从基态波函数中演生出一系列延展分布的退禁闭边缘激发。</p><h4 id="对应关系">对应关系</h4><p>在上节我们论述过，拓扑态基态波函数的边缘纠缠谱与边缘激发的能谱有对应关系，尤其是，对VBS型不动点波函数，其边缘纠缠谱只包含边缘自由度的信息，而不包含非拓扑的信息。这提示我们对VBS型基态波函数采取延展性 的划分，由此产生一系列的边缘激发，如图 1.2(c) 所示。可以看出，此时纠缠哈密顿量 <span class="math inline">\(H_{E}\)</span> 描述的是边缘自由度在体中的相互作用，因而我们称此时的纠缠谱为体纠缠谱。在本文中，我们将通过几个例子说明，在对VBS型基态波函数做延展 划分，并取合适的子块长度和适当的近似下，得到的体纠缠能谱就是与原SPT相连的量子临界点的能谱，一个简化的框架示意见图 1.4(a)。</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20200927020451050.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><p>显然，我们的工作是对用纠缠谱读取拓扑态基态波函数信息的一个深化，它将人们原有的体-边缘对应(Bulk-Edge Correspondence)推广到体-边缘-量子临界点对应(Bulk-Edge-QCP Correspondence)，如图 1.4(b)所示，在这三角对应中，量子纠缠起到了桥梁的作用。</p><h3 id="规划">规划</h3><p>根据上述的铺拆，本文的主要内容如下:</p><ol type="1"><li>基态波函数的边缘

<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> 是电极中电子的模式数目; 对手多个电极问题（大于两个）,Büttiker指出，两个电极之间的电流和电压差没有固定的关系。如图2.3所示，我们考虑N个电极。每个电极的电流和电压分别标记为: <span class="math inline">\(I_{p}\)</span> 和 <span class="math inline">\(V_{p}\)</span> (指标p代表第p个电极)。</p><p>利用Landauer-Büttiker公式，电流和电压之间的关系为: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}I_{p} &amp;=\sum_{q} G_{p q}\left(V_{p}-V_{q}\right) \\G_{p q} &amp;=\frac{e^{2}}{h} T_{q p}\end{aligned}\]</span> 其中，</p><ul><li><span class="math inline">\(T_{q p}\)</span> 是透射矩阵的元素，表示电极q和电极p之间的透射概率，见图2.3。</li></ul><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210111013830613.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><blockquote><p>图2.3 电极和样品的示意图。</p></blockquote><p>我们运用Landauer-Büttiker公式，来分析拓扑态（例如QH, QAH, QSH）的边界态的电导。</p><h4 id="qh的情况">QH的情况</h4><p>下面我们分析一下QH的情况，并考虑边界上只有一个手性态，它沿着逆时针方向运动（同样适用于QAH的分析）。我们连接4个电极到样品上，电极之间的非零的透射概率系数有: <span class="math inline">\(T_{41}=T_{24}=T_{32}=T_{13}=1\)</span> （其他电极之间的透射概率为零 <span class="math inline">\()\)</span> 。因此, <strong>电流和电压</strong>之间的关系为: <span class="math display">\[\left(\begin{array}{l}I_{1} \\I_{2} \\I_{3} \\I_{4}\end{array}\right)=\frac{e^{2}}{h}\left(\begin{array}{cccc}1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}V_{1} \\V_{2} \\V_{3} \\V_{4}\end{array}\right)\]</span> 此外，我们需要考虑电流<strong>守恒</strong>公式: <span class="math inline">\(I_{1}+I_{2}+I_{3}+I_{4}=0_{\circ}\)</span> 并且，我们设置 <span class="math inline">\(V_{4}=0\)</span> 。所以，上述公式简化为，, <span class="math display">\[\left(\begin{array}{l}I_{1} \\I_{2} \\I_{3}\end{array}\right)=\frac{e^{2}}{h}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}V_{1} \\V_{2} \\V_{3}\end{array}\right)\]</span> 另外，电阻矩阵的定义是电导矩阵的<strong>逆矩阵</strong>。因此， <span class="math display">\[R=\left(\begin{array}{lll}R_{11} &amp; R_{12} &amp; R_{13} \\R_{21} &amp; R_{22} &amp; R_{23} \\R_{31} &amp; R_{32} &amp; R_{33}\end{array}\right)=\frac{h}{e^{2}}\left(\begin{array}{lll}1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\end{array}\right)\]</span> 最后，我们利用上面的公式来 计算QH的</p><ul><li>Hall电阻</li><li>和纵向电阻</li></ul><h4 id="hall电阻">Hall电阻</h4><p>首先，我们先计算Hall电阻：在电极3和电极4上加上电压，然后测量电极1 和 电极2 之间的电流。 因此 <span class="math inline">\(V_{4}=0\)</span> 和 <span class="math inline">\(I_{1}=-I_{2 \circ}\)</span> 所以, Hall电阻定义成 <span class="math display">\[R_{H}=\frac{V_{3}-V_{4}}{I_{1}}\]</span> 根据电流和电压之间的关系, 我们知道: <span class="math display">\[V_{3}=R_{31} I_{1}+R_{32} I_{2} \]</span> 所以 <span class="math display">\[R_{H}=R_{31}-R_{32}=-\frac{h}{e^{2}}\]</span></p><h4 id="纵向电阻">纵向电阻</h4><p>然后，我们来计算纵向电阻：在电极1和电极4上加上电压，然后测量电极2和电极3之间的电流。因为 <span class="math inline">\(V_{4}=0\)</span> 和 <span class="math inline">\(I_{3}=-I_{2},\)</span> 以及 <span class="math inline">\(V_{1}=R_{12} I_{2}+R_{13} I_{3 \circ}\)</span> 所以, 纵向电阻 <span class="math display">\[R_{L}=R_{12}-R_{13}=0\]</span> 总而言之, 当我们测量QH的边界态的时候，Hall电阻是量子化的（<span class="math inline">\(\frac{h}{e^{2}}\)</span>） 纵向电导等于0</p><h4 id="求解透射矩阵">求解透射矩阵</h4><p>然后，我们来考虑一般性输运问题。关键的问题就是如何求解透射矩阵 <span class="math inline">\(T_{q p^{\circ}}\)</span> 我们可以计算散射矩阵（S-矩阵）来解决这个问题。比如我们考虑两个电极之间的电子运输，那么S-矩阵是， <span class="math display">\[S=\left(\begin{array}{ll}r &amp; t^{\prime} \\t &amp; r^{\prime}\end{array}\right)\]</span> 其中， <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> 是反射矩阵， <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> 是两个电极之间的透射矩阵; <span class="math inline">\(r^{\prime}\)</span> 和 <span class="math inline">\(t^{\prime}\)</span> 是反方向的反射和透射矩阵。有很多办法可以计算S-矩阵。下面我们介绍如何用格林函数的方法， 即Fisher-Lee公式 <span class="math inline">\(^{\{58]}\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[S_{n m, q p}=-\delta_{n m} \delta_{q p}+\frac{i \hbar}{a} \sqrt{v_{n q} v_{m p}} \sum_{q_{i}, p_{j}} \chi_{n}^{*}\left(q_{i}\right) G_{q p}^{R}\left(q_{i}, p_{j}\right) \chi_{m}\left(p_{j}\right)\]</span> 其中</p><ul><li><span class="math inline">\(n(m)\)</span> 表示电极 <span class="math inline">\(q(p)\)</span> 中的导电通道（本质上是电极 中费密面附近电子的模式数目);</li><li><span class="math inline">\(q_{i}\)</span> 是电极q中的晶格位置;</li><li><span class="math inline">\(v_{n q}\)</span> 是电极q中的电子的纵向速度</li><li>$ _{n}$ 是波函数;</li><li><span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> 是晶格常数;</li></ul><p><span class="math inline">\(G_{q p}^{R}\left(q_{i}, p_{j}\right)\)</span> 是延迟格林函，即从电极q中的晶格位置i到电板p中的晶格位置j的传播子，定义 为 <span class="math display">\[G^{R / A}(E)=\frac{1}{E-H \pm i \eta}\]</span> 其中</p><ul><li>H是整体哈密顿量（包含样品种电极）;</li><li><span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> 是无限小的正数;</li><li><span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> 是入射电子能量。</li></ul><p><span class="math inline">\(G^{R / A}\)</span> 是延迟/超前格林函数: <span class="math inline">\(\left(G^{R}\left(q_{i}, p_{j}\right)\right)^{*}=G^{A}\left(p_{j}, q_{i}\right)_{\circ}\)</span> 并且，透射矩阵跟格林函数的关系,可以写成简洁的形式: <span class="math display">\[T_{q \neq p}=\sum_{n m}\left|s_{n m, q p}\right|^{2}=\operatorname{Tr}\left[\Gamma_{q} G^{R} \Gamma_{p} G^{A}\right]\]</span> 其中</p><ul><li><span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\left(q_{i}, q_{i}^{\prime}\right)=\chi_{n}\left(q_{i}\right) \frac{\hbar v_{n q}}{a} \chi_{n}^{*}\left(q_{i}^{\prime}\right)\)</span> 表示电极和 样品之间的耦合</li></ul><p>在本文中，我们考虑样品的哈密顿量通常为紧束溥模型。具体的计算方法将在下一个章节介绍。</p><h3 id="迭代green-函数方法">迭代Green 函数方法</h3><p>对于二维体系，我们往往需要考虑尺寸比较大的紧束缚模型。并且，对一个维度很大 的矩阵求逆，在数值计算上需要花费很大的内存和计算时间。有两个解决办法:</p><ol type="1"><li>第一个办法就是采用稀疏矩阵技术，这个方法依赖于具体的问题;</li><li>第二个办法就是迭代格林函数的方法，这个办法原则上可以运用于任何输运问题</li></ol>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>杂质模型及其微扰理论</p><p>[TOC]</p><h2 id="非磁性杂质模型及t矩阵">非磁性杂质模型及T矩阵</h2><p>在处理量子磁性问题之前，我们来考虑一个简单的情况，即单个非磁性杂质原子处于金属导电电子库之中。杂质原子如果存在净电荷，则会和导电电子之间产生库伦相互作用。库伦排斥带来一个瞬时有效静电场，由于静电场在金属中会有屏蔽效应，所以在这种经典的观点下，我们也足以知道长程的库伦排斥在金属中应当会被<strong>屏蔽</strong>。</p><h3 id="有效势模型">有效势模型</h3><p>事实上，这种效应来自于电子相互作用在粒子空穴通道上的自能修正。由无规相近似可以知道，原本困指数形式的库伦排斥会被屏蔽成指数衰减。这种库伦屏蔽效应一般来讲，在金属中是非常显著的。有效的作用<strong>力程</strong>一般只能达到<strong>0.1nm</strong>。由描述金属的费米液体理论可知，杂质原子带来的短程排斥作用是无关相互作用。因此，我们可以进一步采用Hatree-Fock 平均场，从而将问题简化为一个有效势模型。 <span class="math display">\[H=\sum_{ k , \sigma} \epsilon_{ k } c_{ k , \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{ k , \sigma}+\sum_{ k , k ^{\prime}} V_{ k , k ^{\prime}} c_{ k , \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{ k ^{\prime}, \sigma}\]</span> 其中 <span class="math inline">\(c_{ k , \sigma}\)</span> 是导带电子的潭灭算符，<span class="math inline">\(V_{ k , k ^{\prime}}\)</span> 是杂质原子带来的有效势。为了对比,我们先考虑最简单的情况，即一块纯净的金属材料。取 <span class="math inline">\(V_{ k , k ^{\prime}}=0\)</span>，上式简化为自由电子模型 <span class="math display">\[H_{f r e e}=\sum_{ k , \sigma} \epsilon_{ k } c_{ k , \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{ k , \sigma}\]</span> 通过求其配分函数，再利用统计力学，我们可以得到纯净金属的线性比热系数 <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> 为 <span class="math display">\[\gamma=\frac{2 \pi^{2} k_{B}^{2}}{3} \rho_{0}\left(\epsilon_{F}\right)\]</span> 以及零温零场顺磁磁化率 <span class="math inline">\(\chi(0)\)</span> 为 <span class="math display">\[\chi(0)=2 \mu_{B}^{2} \rho_{0}\left(\epsilon_{F}\right)\]</span> 其中 <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{0}\left(\epsilon_{F}\right)\)</span> 是费米面处的态密度。由于式(2.1)不含相互作用四算子项，形式上总 可以进行对角化。在对角化表象下，哈密顿表现为 <span class="math display">\[H=\sum_{\alpha, \sigma} \epsilon_{\alpha} c_{\alpha, \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{\alpha, \sigma}\]</span> <strong>结论</strong></p><blockquote><p>对比, 我们知道一个<strong>非磁性</strong>杂质带来的局域有效势并不能给整个系统带来<strong>任何定性的变化</strong>，因为通过一个幻正变换可以把非磁性杂质问题<strong>转化</strong>为自由电子模型。因此，有效势模型<strong>不可能解释</strong>近藤问题。</p></blockquote><h3

\rho(\epsilon)=\rho(\epsilon)-\rho_{0}(\epsilon)\)</span></p></blockquote><p>同时，我们也知道，尽管没有定性的改变，有效势却会<strong>重整化</strong>自由电子的参数。这和朗道费米液体的思想是一致的。非磁性杂质仍然具有与式<span class="math inline">\(\gamma=\frac{2 \pi^{2} k_{B}^{2}}{3} \rho_{0}\left(\epsilon_{F}\right)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\chi(0)=2 \mu_{B}^{2} \rho_{0}\left(\epsilon_{F}\right)\)</span> 相同形式的比热和磁化率。由于费米面处的态密度会被非磁性杂质重整，这就要求我们具体去计算费米面处态密度的变化。为此，我们采用<strong>推迟格林函数</strong>形式。</p><p>首先我们将哈密顿量写为矩阵算符形式，即 <span class="math inline">\(H=H_{f r e e}+V\)</span> 。下面我们利用推迟格林函数的矩阵形 式来计算态密度。矩阵形式的推迟格林函数 <span class="math inline">\(G^{R}(\epsilon)\)</span> 定义为 <span class="math display">\[\left(\epsilon+i 0^{+}-H\right) G^{R}(\epsilon)=I\]</span> 态密度 <span class="math

<span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho(\epsilon)=\rho(\epsilon)-\rho_{0}(\epsilon)\)</span> 其中 <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{0}(\epsilon)\)</span> 定义为 <span class="math display">\[\rho_{0}(\epsilon)=-\frac{1}{\pi} \operatorname{Im} \operatorname{Tr} G_{0}^{R}(\epsilon)\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(G_{0}^{R}(\epsilon)\)</span> 是无磁性杂质 <span class="math inline">\(V=0\)</span> 的自由推迟格林函数的矩阵形式。容易证明在有效势模型下，同样存在电子库伦作用微扰论中的Dyson方程，即 <span class="math display">\[G^{R}(\epsilon)=G_{0}^{R}(\epsilon)+G_{0}^{R}(\epsilon) V G^{R}(\epsilon)\]</span>

到末态 <span class="math inline">\(\left( k ^{\prime}, \downarrow\right)\)</span> 为例，则可以用费曼图表示出散射过程。如图所示</p><p><img src="http://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20200926101152539.png"

上面考虑的过程是初态到中间态或者中间态到末态发生自旋反转。对于无自旋反转过程T矩阵的对角矩阵S ^ 相关项会有贡献。类似上面方法把对角项考虑进来最终我们得到总的二阶T矩阵考虑各种散射初末态后的<strong>总散射振幅</strong> <span class="math display">\[T^{(2)}(\epsilon)=J^{2} \sum_{ k ^{\prime \prime}}

第二项来自自旋反转过程</p><p>第一项给出和温度无关的相，而自旋反转过程给出明显的温度依赖。我们重点关心第二项。由于电阻极小是稀磁合金中的普片现象，具体的导带电子能带形式对结果不应有大的影响，我们取一个简化的态密度即认为态密度在能带宽度范围以内是常数 <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\epsilon)=\rho_{F}\)</span> 。对 <span

^{\prime \prime}} \frac{f_{ k ^{\prime \prime}}}{\epsilon-\epsilon_{ k ^{\prime \prime}}}=J \rho_{F} \ln \frac{k_{B} T}{D}\]</span> 至二阶为止总散射矩阵给出的散射几率为 <span class="math

inline">\(J&gt;0\)</span>，上式随着温度的降低而电阻增大。如果把不可忽略的声子的贡献 <span class="math inline">\(A T^{5}\)</span> 加上，则上式恰好会给我们一个极小值点。</p><p>这很好的解释了电阻极小的实现现象。如果考虑有效滚度 <span class="math inline">\(c_{i m p}\)</span> 的磁性杂质（但是杂质之间的耦合不予考虑），则总电阻贡献为 <span class="math display">\[R=R_{0}\left(1-4 J \rho_{F} \ln \frac{k_{B} T}{D}\right)+A T^{5}\]</span> 由上式可以解出电阻极小值的位置，即 <span class="math display">\[T_{\min }=B c_{i m p}^{1 / 5}\]</span> 电阻极小正比于杂质浓度的五分之一次方。这个结论也与实验很好的吻合。另外，除了温度极小，人们发现稀磁合金中的磁化率也会有反常效应。局域磁矩如果不和导带电子奉合，那应当满足居里外斯定律。然而，实验发现，在稀磁合金中磁矩在低温下和居里外斯定律有很大偏差，磁矩在低温下逐渐趋于饱和最后等于零。也就是在低温下，局域磁矩不存在。这其实是因为电子和磁矩之间的反铁磁交换作用在低温下倾向于在磁矩附近形成自旋取向与局域磁矩相反的电子，在低温下相反自旋的电子围绕这局域磁矩形成一个屏蔽磁矩的“云"，最终使得局域磁矩被完全屏蔽。这个物理图像是就人们熟知的近藤单态，这一点在后面的章节会详细阐述。</p>]]></content>

Wilson发展，他创建了一套不同寻常的在随着系统能量尺度的改变，系统哈密顿量的流动过程中。利用适当数值技术，他进一步得到了s-d交换模型的基态以及低温行为的确定结果[3]。总的来说，Wilson把量子场论中重整化的思想和凝聚态中标度的思想结合起来，而数值上实现了非微扰计算，从而得到了对于近藤问题从高温到低温所有温度区间的正确解。随后，P.Nozières 关于Wilson数值方法在低温下的情况给出了一致。这作看一下似乎很奇怪，因为低温下的强耦合相本身应当是超出微扰论的结果。而一旦形成了强耦合相，在基态上的激发态行为却非常类似手费米液体，可以用传统的微扰展开来计算。这个看似奇怪的过程其实正是重整化群思想的核心。重整化群的最重要的一个要点是不动点，即系统出现完美的自相似性，不论能标如何移动，系统行为不再发生变化。这里强耦合项就是一个不动点，这个不动点是稳定的，即如果给它任何扰动，系统会自动回到这个稳定的相。如果把这个稳定的相作为平均场意义下的鞍点，那么我们完全可以构建一个鞍点附近的微扰理论。这就是“建立在非微扰基础上的微扰论”的准确含义。P.Nozières的朗道费米液体描述是唯象理论，K.Yamada 基于安德森模型，最终给出了低温强耦合相费米液体的微观理论[5, 6]。紧接着，对手自旋1/2的s-d 模型，在1980年 由N.Andre和P.B.Wiegmann 采用Bethe ansatz, 给出了严格解。对这个问题，之所以可以得到严格解，很大程度上依赖于单杂质问题的各项同性和旋转不变性假设。基于这个前提，我们可以把问题转换成一维（且在费米面附近线性化）模型，从而最终可以利用在一维海森堡模型问题中所提出的Bethe ansatz方法来处理。s-d 模型的Bethe ansatz解法可以给出从高温到低温的解析结果，并给出一组积分方程，从中可以得到各个温度区域的热力学行为。</p><h3 id="重费米子">重费米子</h3><p>至此，关于金属中近藤问题的简单描述基本告一段落。然而新的问题总不断被提出，例如为了更加符合实际的物理情形，人们试图进一步考虑3d 电子的轨道简并以及晶体场效应。这就给问题带来了更多需要考虑的自由度，而自由度的增加会大大增大Wilson数值重整化群方法的计算量，使得问题的解认变得非常困难。另一方面，实验上稀土元素合金的研究（比如锦金属化合物等）发现它们有类似于近藤效应的现象，类似于单杂质问题。这一类化合物在低温下的反常行为问题被称之为<strong>重费米子</strong>问题。关于这方面的研究进一步让理论学家考虑推广安德森杂质模型到安德森格点模型。它之所以吸引人是因为重费米子问题在低温下常常有很丰富的物理相图。在一些参数区间体现出非传统超导特性，一些区间出现磁有序，另一些情况下则在极低温下仍保持顺磁性等等。对于安德森格点模型及其相关问题至今仍是非常活跃的研究方向。由于不是本论文的重点，所以这里仅一带而过。</p><p>量子磁性杂质，安德森格点模型，重费米子系统，这些问题的核心都是过渡金属或者稀土元素原子内电子的短程库伦排斥所导致的<strong>强关联</strong>效应。这和高温超导的物理模型也非常相似。高温超导(以铜基为例)往往都有铜氧面，并且在铜原子内的库伦排斥作用现在被认为是重中之重。强库伦排斥和安德森模型里一样，在适当参数区间体现出局域磁矩性质，而考虑铜原子之间的耦合,则出现局域磁矩之间的相互作用。而在安德森格点模型中，人们也通常考虑格点间的海森堡交换作用。除此之外，高温超导物理还需要电子或者空穴渗杂。这些额外的电子或空穴在相互作用着的局域磁矩之间运动。这一物理图像和Anderson-Heisenberg 晶格模型很类似。因此，对于近藤问题的衍生<strong>难免</strong>会涉及到<strong>超导</strong>物理。总而言之，当前强关联问题的研究还远远没有到达令人满意的程度。我们还面临着很多挑战。而近藤问题，可以作为一个<strong>承上启下</strong>的实际例子，不仅帮助我们理清强关联问题的发展脉络掌握研究方法，而且可以给未来新研究方向提供有用的线索。</p><h2 id="拓扑量子系统中的近藤效应">拓扑量子系统中的近藤效应</h2><p>近年来，由于在</p><ul><li>低能耗输运</li><li>拓扑量子计算</li></ul><p>等方面的潜在应用价值，拓扑量子系统成为凝聚态物理的一大热点问题。</p><ol type="1"><li>近藤效应在拓扑量子系统中扮演什么样的角色？</li><li>强耦合区的物理和在普通金属中有什么区别？</li><li>会不会产生新的拓扑态？</li></ol><p>等等问题也随之而来。这一章我们主要介绍在这个领域目前的研究现状。我们将要从如下几个方面进行阐述。</p><ul><li>第一，巡游电子和局域轨道的耦合打开的能隙在特定的布里渊区动量点附近带来了能带反转，即s-d耦合导致的拓扑近藤绝缘体。</li><li>第二，拓扑近藤绝缘体的与众不同的表面态性质。</li><li>第三，单磁性杂质与拓扑量子态（扑绝缘体体系和拓扑半金属）的耦合导致的近藤效应，近藤单态问题。</li></ul><p>在接下来的两个章节，我将介绍自己关于这个问题所做的两个具体工作。</p><h2 id="拓扑近藤绝缘体">拓扑近藤绝缘体</h2><p>这一节，我们将详细介绍由一种近藤强关联效应带来的强拓扑绝缘体。首先我们介绍近藤绝缘体和它的简要研究历史。接着讨论近藤绝缘体怎样才能成为拓扑非平庸材料，并讨论拓扑近藤绝缘体的基本理论模型。最后我们讨论实验上的最近进展。</p><h3 id="近藤绝缘体及早期研究">1近藤绝缘体及早期研究</h3><p>近藤绝缘体是指由于局域磁矩和巡游电子耦合的强关联效应给系统带来一个窄能隙的绝缘体材料。在上世纪七十年代以前，局域轨道的电子起重要作用的磁性材料通常被人们<strong>认为是电荷绝缘</strong>的。然而五十年前， <span class="math inline">\(SmB _{6}\)</span> 的发现打破了这一认识。Anthony Menth等人发现[1] <span class="math inline">\(SmB _{6}\)</span> 在室温下是一个顺磁金属，而非绝缘体。所谓顺磁金属是指在室温下，它既有巡游电子的金属行为又有稠密的局域磁矩。磁矩在室温下是顺磁，满足居里外斯定律 <span class="math display">\[\chi(T)=\frac{1}{3} \frac{\left\langle M^{2}\right\rangle}{T+\theta}\]</span> 随着温度的降低，这些磁矩由于和巡游电子的耦合，会在低温下被屏蔽形成近藤单态。</p><p class="note note-warning">由于近藤单态的形成，局域电子能带与巡游电子能带通过<strong>耦合打开一个能隙</strong>。这个能隙可以简单理解为打开近藤单态所需的能量。</p><p>然而在早期关于近藤绝缘体的研究中，人们并没有向近藤效应的方向进行思考。Brian Maple等人在SmS 体系里也观察到类似的窄带隙行为，它们将其解释为稀土元素离子中的相干价键的涨落破坏磁性序，从而使得局域f 轨道电子发生退局域化而进入导带中[2, 3]。基于上述实验，Varma 等人[4-6] 提出局域f电子和非局域的d电子会形成一种激子序，从而两者的能带发生耦合打开能隙。</p><h4 id="近藤格点模型">近藤格点模型</h4><p>随后Sebastian 提出了<strong>近藤格点模型</strong>的想法，它用来描述受到运动的电子背景影响下的局域磁矩格点系统，即 <span class="math display">\[H=-t \sum_{\langle i, j\rangle \sigma}\left(c_{i \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{j \sigma}+H .

首先对于不考虑费米面高阶修正的wraping效果下，文献[46-48] 进行了细致研究。此体系的安德森模型哈密顿量可以总写为 <span class="math display">\[H=H_{0}+H_{h y b}+H_{d}\]</span> 其中</p><ul><li>拓扑表面态哈密顿</li></ul><p><span class="math display">\[H_{0}=\sum_{ k } c_{ k }^{\dagger}\left[\hbar v_{F}(\sigma \times k ) \cdot \hat{z}-\mu\right] c_{ k }\]</span> - 描述局域轨道电子</p><p><span class="math display">\[H_{d}=\sum_{\sigma} \epsilon_{d} n_{d \sigma}+U n_{d \uparrow} n_{d \downarrow}\]</span> - 导带电子和局域电子的耦合</p><p><span class="math display">\[H_{h y b}=\sum_{ k } V_{ k } c_{ k }^{\dagger} d+H .

type="1"><li>早在量子力学建立之前的1900年，Drude提出的经典自由电子模型就可以用来解释金属中电子的输运性质，比如欧姆定律和Wiedemann-Franz定律。</li><li>很多实验表明，尽管金属中电子之间的长程库仑排斥很强，但是金属的许多性质却和<strong>无相互作用费米气类似</strong>，比如线性比热， Pauli顺磁磁化率与温度无关 等等，为了解释这些现象Sommerfeld在1928年从量子力学出发，考虑到电子是费米子，满足Pauli不相容原理，重新建立了自由电子论。 Sommerfeld的自由电子论揭示了金属中一个非常重要的性质：在低温下，金属的很多性质只由<strong>费米面附近的电子决定</strong>，而不是金属中的所有电子，费米面的存在对金属性质的影响很大。</li><li>一个多体系统的行为竞然和自由系统的行为类似，这背后一定有深刻的物理机制。直到1956年，这个迷团才被Landau提出的唯象理论解开，Landau指出金属中电子的这种类似于自由费米气体的行为并<strong>不是一个偶然</strong>，而 是在某些特定情况下多体费米子系统的<strong>固有特性</strong>。费米液体理论并没有给出这个问题的严格解，但是为我们理解相互作用费米子系统的的<strong>低能</strong>行为提供了基础。 这套理论不仅可以用<strong>很少的几个唯象参数</strong>就可以对费米液体系统的低能激发态有很好的描述，而且能够解释和预测系统的很多现象。我们 将在后面介绍Landau费米液体理论的一些基本性质。</li><li>同样的在1928年，Bloch提出了单电子能带论，在Sommerfeld自由电子论的基础上考虑了固体中<strong>周期</strong>排列的离子会使得电子感受到周期势，这一理论使得我们可以<strong>统一</strong>地理解金属，绝缘体和半导体的性质，为固体的能带理论奠定多体系统的电子密度出发，很好的处理电子关联较小的系统，这一方法已成为 凝聚态物理中最为常用的计算方法之一。</li></ol><p>以上发展的这些理论可以很好的帮助我们理解电子之间关联作用较弱的系统，但是如果电子之间的关联足够大，那么单电子近似不再成立，这些理论就不再适用于电子间存在强关联系统，此时就得寻求新的理论。</p><h3 id="强关联系统的电子输运">强关联系统的电子输运</h3><ol

他们发现费米液体的基态不一定对应于无相互作用的费米气体，还可以破缺到 超导态。当费米面附近两个自旋和动量都相反的电子之间通过晶格振动产生 有效的吸引相互作用时，这样两个电子就会形成Cooper对，这些Cooper对会发 生Bose-Einstein凝聚从而形成超导。BCS理论的出现标志着凝聚态物理理论进 入了一个新的纪元。</p><ol start="2"

响[20]。1949年Mott提出了Mott金属-绝缘体相变的概念来描述这一类由电子间 强关联导致的绝缘体 [21] 。</p><p>在Mott绝缘体提出后的很长时间内，很少有研究人员关注Mott绝缘体中 的物理，更不用说将超导电性与Mott绝缘体联系在一起。直到1986年发现了铜 氧化合物高温超导体 <span class="math inline">\([22],\)</span> Anderson <span class="math inline">\(^{[23]}\)</span> 提出Mott绝缘体中电子间的排斥相互作用<strong>可能会导致高温超导</strong>，这才<strong>让Mott绝缘体的研究彻底翻身</strong>。目前绝大多数研 究者认为高温超导体的物理就是渗杂的Mott绝缘体的物理[24]，因此为了研究清楚高温超导体的物理性质，首先要能理解未渗杂的Mott绝缘体的物理。</p><h2 id="费米液体理论">费米液体理论</h2><p>Landau费米液体理论最核心的假设是</p><p class="note note-primary">我们可以从无相互作用费米气体的

而 <span class="math display">\[\xi_{ k } \propto\left(| k |-k_{F}\right)\]</span> Landau费米液体理论表明费米面附近电子之间的散射很弱，这是由于系 统中存在费米面导致的。我们可以用一个简单的物理图像来说明。在接近零温 时，费米面内是全部占据的，在引入相互作用后费米面附近的粒子会互相散射，然而由于Pauli不相容原理，这些准粒子能够发生散射的相空间变得很小。 因此如果考虑两个费米面上的准粒子之间的散射，根据能量守恒原理，散射后的两个粒子仍在费米面上，但是由于费米面都被占据，因此它们可以散射的相空间为零，所以散射不会发生，因此准粒子的寿命在费米面上无穷大。</p><p>在Landau唯象的提出费米液体理论后不久<strong>多体微扰理论</strong>就给出了详细的推导 <span class="math inline">\([85-88]

At first I was deeply shaken. I was so excited that I could not think of sleep. So I left the house and awaited the sunrise on the top of a rock.</p><p>（那是深夜的三点多，当最后的计算结果摆在我面前，我一下子被深深的震惊到了。我太激动了以至于没想到睡觉，我走出房子，静静的等着太阳升到石头之上。）</p></blockquote><p>人生有很多的体验，这种站在人类辉煌的一个节点，倾刻间暴发出快感、惬意，洞悉堪称巅峰体验。</p><p>初入科学，就看到很多科学前辈讲述诺贝奖等荣誉不能太重要，你真正的动机应该更高，更纯粹。我想海森堡的这种体验，也许是比荣誉更加重要的一种动机。</p><h4 id="少年朗道">少年朗道</h4><p>看到一个坚毅的少年，即使无法完全理解论文，却坚持啃下来。很早就学会独立思考，这种风格贯穿了他的一生。</p><blockquote><p>“列宁格勒大学图书馆阅览室的书架前站着一位18岁的少年，一缕黑色的卷发散落在他那高高的漂亮的额头上。他刚拿到最新一期的《Annlen der Physik》。在这本杂志中他读到了薛定谔发表的第一篇量子力学论文《量子化就是本征值问题》。少年并未意识到，他<strong>人生之中的重要时刻降临</strong>了，这个时刻决定了他的整个未来。</p><p>虽然文章他<strong>不能完全理解</strong>，但还是啃了下来。如他所言，这篇文章深深地震撼了他，他在初次接触相对论时也曾感受到过这种震撼。</p><p>未来的科学家通常都是通过自己的导师——更有经验和资历的科学家来了解本学科知识的。而关于量子力学，朗道却无人可以请教。不是因为缺少优秀的老师，而是因为量子力学本身尚不存在。他只能<strong>依靠自己的力量</strong>。</p><p>由于这段经历的影响，他并不像别人那样欣赏那些<strong>踩着梯子在书架上层翻阅藏书的学者们</strong>。朗道说：“从那些厚厚的书本中我们无法学到任何新的东西。那些厚厚的著作不过是<strong>埋葬往日思想的坟墓</strong>。”</p><p>在这种独特的学习过程中<strong>朗道</strong>形成了受用终生的学习方法。他翻阅大量的学术期刊，但只读每篇文章中提出问题的部分和结尾部分的结论，直接<strong>跳过中间的论证</strong>过程。他说：“<strong>我需要知道作者做了什么，至于如何做的，我自己更清楚。</strong>”</p></blockquote><p>朗道的经历让我意识到自己的缺陷，我很喜欢翻阅前人的书籍，甚至成为一种依赖。我在阅读中学习，学习之后练习，模仿中锻炼出能力。书中的知识对我来说是新的，对人类来说不是，创造出新的知识才是对人类知识边界的扩展。我沉迷于内部，却步不前。</p><p>但是作为一个平凡的学生，我要如何看待朗道如此霸道的研究学习方法？</p><p>我没有他那么强大的能力，做不到他的方式。不过我学到了阅读的一种方式，就是先看背景和结论，过程怎么做？你先猜想和思考，这样会激发你的探索欲望，锻炼独立思考的能力。也许有一天可以成长到朗道那样，即使没有，也会有成长进步。</p><h4 id="费曼">费曼</h4><p>一套伟大的物理教科书 费曼讲义 最后写道 ：</p><blockquote><p>I wanted most to give you some <strong>appreciation</strong> of the wonderful world and the physicist’s way of looking at it, which, I believe, is a major part of the true culture of modern times.</p><p>Perhaps you will not only have some appreciation of this culture; <em>it is even possible that you may want to <strong>join</strong> in <strong>the greatest adventure</strong> that the human mind has ever begun.</em></p></blockquote><p>吸引我进入物理学的男人，高中看了费曼的几本书。他的很多故事非常吸引我。</p><h4 id="爱因斯坦探索的动机">爱因斯坦：探索的动机</h4><p>爱因斯坦在普朗克生日上讲话</p><blockquote><p>人们总想以最适当的方式来画出一幅简化的和易领悟的世界图像，于是他就试图用他的这种世界体系（cosmos）来代替经验的世界，并来征服它。这就是画家、诗人、思辨哲学家和自然科学家所做的。他们都按自己的方式去做。各人都把世界体系及其构成作为他的感情生活的支点，以便由此找到他在个人经验的狭小范围内所不能找到的宁静和安定。</p></blockquote><p>每当迷茫的时候，每当规划人生新路途的时候，我喜欢从最基本的观念出发，于是我就会来看看这段话。</p><h4 id="仪鸣求知路上的风景">仪鸣：求知路上的风景</h4><p>仪鸣讲述了一个女生成为物理学家的历程和困难。但是我兴趣的是她的感悟，对于男女与否都是无关。</p><blockquote><p>我对物理基础科研更深入地热爱始于大三时加入的凝聚态教授课题组，用扫描隧道显微镜探索铜基高温超导材料的实空间特性。</p><p>当时导师让我延续一项数据分析软件的编程工作，用图像处理的方法把低温和高温测到的实空分布图自动将原子逐个对上，这样可以精确得到每一个原子上隧道谱的变温现象。</p><p>那是我<strong>首次直接接触到科学前沿数据。</strong></p><p>翻看着博士师兄们测到的<strong>五颜六色刚出炉的数据时，很是兴奋。</strong></p><p>我每天晚上做完作业便打开电脑，一边摸索学习编程语言一边修改程序。有一天终于写好了程序，我用一套数据开始进行测试。</p><p>铜基超导体在超导转变温度之上一定温区内总是有一个能隙，这个能隙的起源一直众说纷纭，被称之为“赝能隙”。能隙在实空间有不均匀大小变化与分布。当我对接完高低温数据发现，超导临界点上下的能隙分布图几乎看不出变化，难道超导在这个材料上没有影响吗？出于好奇， 我用低温的谱去除高温的谱，惊奇地发现本来花花绿绿的低温分布图归一化后变得颜色很单一，表示得到了相对均匀的能隙分布图。这说明超导态在本来非常不均匀的实空间背景下打开了另外一个均匀的超导能隙，也就意味着这个实空间均匀分布的超导能隙应该不是源于不 均匀分布的赝能隙。</p><p>看到这个结果的时候已经快到<strong>清晨</strong>。我宿舍<strong>窗外是分割波士顿和剑桥的查尔斯河</strong>，对岸波士顿的<strong>楼群后面微微地泛起一抹晨光</strong>，轻柔地温暖着还在熟睡的城市。当时我很<strong>亢奋</strong>，虽然只是极其<strong>微小的发现</strong>，但<strong>第一次品尝对大自然的认知</strong>和领悟的心情真的让人难以忘怀，如同孩子在海边翻开某块石头发现一枚漂亮的小贝壳般<strong>简单并纯粹的快乐</strong></p></blockquote><p>仪鸣本科毕业之后去了斯坦福沈志勋老师的课题组，开始学习用角分辨光电子能谱研究强关联电子体系</p><blockquote><p>我现在还清楚地记得，在凌晨当全世界都安静得只剩下机械泵还在勤劳工作的时候，我们测到的第一个铁基超导体电子结构在电脑屏幕上一点点地“现形”了。</p><p>黑色背景下，如夜空皎洁的月亮般的费米面一条一条出现在眼前，完美，对称。那是我第一次看到微小如电子，它们在一个实体材料里的运行被即时呈现在眼前，那幅美丽的图里藏着许多量子世界的秘密等待着我们去发掘。那一刻我心里不由感叹这项实验技术的强大，决定继续学习用这种实验手段去研究和我一样新的铁基超导材料。</p></blockquote><h4 id="牛谦初涉电子拓扑">牛谦：初涉电子拓扑</h4><p>学术界也会遇到迷弟追星，如果那个人刚好是自己的亲人呢？</p><blockquote><p>女儿转来照片，是哈佛大学物理教授Halperin 在上课，黑板上赫然列出了我的一篇论文。自己的工作能让女儿感到自豪，确确实实令我有些得意。Halperin 是我景仰的老前辈，也是已故同学冯奚乔的博士导师。但我懂得，他列出这篇文章的原因不是我，而是文章的另一个作者，Thouless，2016 年诺贝尔物理学奖获得者之一，也是我的博士导师。这篇文章是我攻读博士期间与导师和吴咏时老师合作而成。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>由于时差，睡下不久又醒来，一看表凌晨4 点。我那个问题<strong>魂牵梦绕，</strong>到此仍然没有着落。但见了导师总得给个交代，于是我拿出纸笔，作了最后一次“挣扎”。 突然想到，如果我能证明结果不依赖于磁通，不就可以做那个平均了吗？我把电荷转移的表达式对磁通求导，用格林函数表达出来，一下子曙光透亮，看到了解。哈哈，真是“蓦然回首，那人却在灯火阑珊处”。上午，我迫不及待地赶到了Cavendish Lab，找到Thouless向他作了汇报。他很快明白了我的意思，表示：“<strong>嗯，就是它了</strong>”</p></blockquote><p>和牛谦老师吃饭的那晚，其实第一感受是他的外貌，很像典型的稍微有点富态的中国传统农民。路上闲聊，得知他是第一届恢复高考的考生，只知道三所大学，本来想去山西师范的，结果被北京大学录取了，当时不知道北大厉害。本来以为自己程度考不上李政道奖学金出国，但是室友去考了，他觉得比室友厉害，所以也报名了。考上奖学金选美国学校，有个朋友的女朋友去康奈尔大学，朋友怕他竞争就跟他说你去华盛顿大学吧，华盛顿大学好啊。他去了华盛顿大学的另外3个同学都选了导师，刚好Thouless转到华盛顿，他就选了Thouless。感慨个人在时代面前是就像小船在大浪中的渺小。 我回去一查他的资料：美国奥斯丁大学教授，兼聘为中科院物理所研究员、北京凝聚态物理国家实验室首席科学家，北京大学杰出校友。最后看到他的导师Thouless原来就是16年诺贝尔得主。 了解他经历的我陷入沉思，如果当年他被山西师范录取了呢？如果没有遇到那个室友呢？如果朋友的女朋友没有去康奈尔呢？如果他提早就选了导师呢？那么他现在会是什么样呢？命运由谁决定：个人努力与历史进程？</p><p>“跋山涉水看不见命运如山，运似轻舟世间沧海——《沧海轻舟.李健》”</p><h4 id="吃瓜群众">吃瓜群众</h4><p>我还记得那时候经常自习到深夜，翻窗户离开二教， 夜风拂过我的肩上，风上是闪耀的群星。群星之下，我和同学讨论晚上看的物理问题。</p><p>不知道为什么，这个画面在我心中是那么的美。现在重新思考，那是一个人可以自由挥洒努力去追逐热爱，追逐的路上有同伴的交流，夜风微凉却很爽，而星空便是宇宙自然，这些我们研究对象的象征。</p><h4 id="别无他求">别无他求</h4><p>在致谢之前，我想先谈谈自己的感悟。回顾博士期间的这几年，心中不禁有很多感慨。五年多的时间中，我一直抱着对理论物理<strong>极大的热情</strong>，<strong>自由</strong>的学习知识做喜欢的研究。其间我认真的努力过，失败过也成功过。但是总的来说失败是远多于成功的。做理论物理有时候让我<strong>感到很艰辛</strong>。因为面对未知的答案，未知的前路，<strong>会让人觉得担忧恐惧</strong>。可是无论如何，我不会改变自己的目标。<strong>因为在思考物理问题的时候，以及在探索未知世界的过程中，让我感到非常兴奋和满足。</strong>这也是我选择物理这条道路的初衷。</p><p>。。。。。。</p><p>最后一句话写给我自己。在博士期间的几年，我最大的毛病是容易<strong>急躁</strong>。在未来的研究道路上，希望我可以保持一个良好而平稳的心态，扎扎实实静下心来享受做理论物理的过程。不论成功或失败，这种人生都是非常值得的。<strong>除此之外，我别无他求。</strong></p><p>——摘自《拓扑量子系统中近藤效应的研究》</p><h4 id="看不尽的不安与迷茫">看不尽的不安与迷茫</h4><p>感谢我的导师 <span class="math inline">\(***\)</span> 研究员对我在科研和生活上的悉心指导和帮助。<span class="math inline">\(***\)</span>老师 学识广博，做学术研究的眼界和品位很高，关心凝聚态物理中的大问题。从进组的第一天就教育我不要轻易随波逐流，做研究要逐渐形成自己的特色。在做研究的起步阶段我经常会处于<strong>学而不思</strong>的状态，感觉有<strong>读不完的文献，看不尽的书</strong>，花了很多时间却<strong>感觉自己几乎原地踏步</strong>，强关联领域百家争鸣的现象让我<strong>感到不安与迷茫</strong>。此时向老师告诉我要<strong>以点带面</strong>，做科研是一个长期积累的过程，尤其是强关联领域，<strong>不能指望也不可能</strong>在对整个领域有了全面的认识之后再开始自己的研究，而且有可能了解的越多，思维上的阻碍也越多。相对 而言我算是组里面比较自由的学生，向老师几乎不会催促我，虽然科研进展会比较慢，但却给了我很多独立思考的空间，而当我的研究遇到阻碍的时候，<span class="math inline">\(***\)</span>老师都会耐心的帮我分析其中的原因，一步步解决问题。在<span class="math inline">\(***\)</span>老师研究风格的耳儒目染下，我收获了很多。</p><p>——摘自《Mott绝缘体的理论研究》</p>]]></content>

id="直播">(5)直播</h3><p>2020新冠疫情之后，更多的学术演讲被录制，或者直接线上举行。但是我对直播的节奏很难把握，除非是要提问，否者没必要去看直播，而需要看录播。有些直播不提供录播回放，但是我们还有解决方式：</p><ul><li>下载直播内容：IDM (缺点：有些直播的加密，破解比较麻烦，不过大部分直播不会加密)</li><li>录屏：EVCapture

id="数学公式的渲染冲突">(1)数学公式的渲染冲突</h4><p>Hexo默认使用<code>hexo-renderer-marked</code>来渲染Markdown，但是这个渲染器在解析Latex语法的时候会和Markdown本身的语法符号产生冲突。网上有很多解决冲突的办法，有的需要手动修改一些js文件，有的需要手动转义。这里我推荐最便捷的方法是直接换一个渲染器Pandoc</p><pre><code class="hljs sql">npm <span class="hljs-keyword">uninstall</span> hexo-renderer-marked <span class="hljs-comment">--save</span>npm <span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> hexo-renderer-pandoc <span class="hljs-comment">--save</span></code></pre><p>Typora编辑器使用的就是Pandoc的语法。</p><p>参考 ：</p><ul><li><p><a

This is done using a truth table, which is a table that lists the inputs together with the corresponding outputs of the gate. For a NOT gate, this is very easy to do. We write the values of the single input bit on the left side of the table and the corresponding outputs on the right: <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l|l}\text { Input } &amp; \text { NOT } \\\hline 0 &amp; 1 \\\hline 1 &amp; 0\end{array}\]</span> Now we will consider more complicated operations that are applied to pairs of bits.

Now that we have a basic idea of how bits can be processed using logic gates, let's</p><h4 id="gate-and-operator">gate and operator</h4><p>since quantum gates are just unitary operators, we'll often go back and forth between the words gate and operator - so keep in mind they mean the <strong>same thing</strong> in this context. <span class="math display">\[gate = operator\]</span> Recall that a unitary operator <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is one where the adjoint is equal to the inverse, meaning <span class="math inline">\(U^{\dagger}=U^{-1} .\)</span> The defining relation for a unitary operator is thus <span class="math display">\[U U^{\dagger}=U^{\dagger} U=I\]</span> In addition, if <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a Hermitian operator, then <span class="math inline">\(U=e^{i H t}\)</span> is unitary.</p><h4 id="matrices-represent-of-gate">matrices represent of gate</h4><p>Recall that quantum operators can be represented by matrices. A quantum gate with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> inputs and outputs can be represented by a matrix of degree <span class="math inline">\(2^{n}\)</span>. For a single qubit, we require a matrix of degree <span class="math inline">\(2^{1}=2 .\)</span> That is, a quantum gate acting on a single qubit will be a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> unitary matrix. A two-qubit gate can be implemented with a matrix of degree <span class="math inline">\(2^{2}=4\)</span> or a <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> matrix.</p><p>Following the procedure used when thinking about classical logic gates, we begin by examining the simplest gate possible, the quantum NOT gate. It turns out that we have already come across the quantum NOT gate-in fact we've already seen many of the single qubit gates. The NOT operation can be implemented with the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> Pauli matrix. It never hurts to review, so let's go back and write out a few basics. The standard or computational basis states are given by <span class="math display">\[|0\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\0\end{array}\right), \quad|1\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{l}0 \\1\end{array}\right)\]</span> The Pauli <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> matrix, which we will often refer to as the NOT operator, is given in matrix form in the standard or computational basis as <span class="math display">\[X=U_{N O T}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}0 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; 0\end{array}\right)\]</span> Hence we have <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l}U_{N O T}|0\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{ll}0 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; 0\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\0\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{l}0 \\1\end{array}\right)=|1\rangle \\U_{N O T}|1\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{ll}0 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; 0\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}0 \\1\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\0\end{array}\right)=|0\rangle\end{array}\]</span> So with respect to the standards or computational basis, the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> matrix acts as a NOT operator. The action of a NOT gate on an arbitrary state <span class="math inline">\(|j\rangle\)</span> can be written using the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{XOR}\)</span> operation as <span class="math display">\[X|j\rangle=|j \oplus 1\rangle\]</span> To see how this works, recall the exclusive OR returns 1 if one or the other of the inputs are <span class="math inline">\(1,\)</span> but 0 otherwise. Hence, if <span class="math inline">\(j=0,\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(X|0\rangle=|0 \oplus 1\rangle=|1\rangle .\)</span> Meanwhile, if <span class="math inline">\(j=1,\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(X|1\rangle=|1 \oplus 1\rangle=|0\rangle\)</span></p><h4 id="example">Example</h4><p>The NOT operator takes |0<span class="math inline">\(\mapsto|1\rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|1\rangle \mapsto|0\rangle .\)</span> Describe the unitary operator that will implement the NOT operation in outer product form, and find its matrix representation with respect to the basis <span class="math display">\[|+\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\1\end{array}\right), \quad|-\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\-1\end{array}\right)\]</span></p><hr /><p><strong>Solution</strong></p><p>In the standard or computational basis, the matrix representation of the NOT operator is given by <span class="math inline">\((8.3) .\)</span> We can also write this as <span class="math display">\[X=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\langle 0|X| 0\rangle &amp; \langle 0|X| 1\rangle \\\langle 1|X| 0\rangle &amp; \langle 1|X| 1\rangle\end{array}\right)\]</span> You can see that this will work if <span class="math display">\[X=|0\rangle\langle 1|+| 1\rangle\langle 0|\]</span> (check it). Then the action of the operator on the standard or computational basis states is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}X|0\rangle &amp;=(|0\rangle\langle 1|+| 1\rangle\langle 0|)|0\rangle \\&amp;=|0\rangle\langle 1 | 0\rangle+|1\rangle\langle 0 | 0\rangle \\&amp;=|1\rangle\end{aligned}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}X|1\rangle &amp;=(|0\rangle\langle 1|+| 1\rangle\langle 0|)|1\rangle \\&amp;=|0\rangle\langle 1 | 1\rangle+|1\rangle\langle 0 | 1\rangle \\&amp;=|0\rangle\end{aligned}\]</span> where we have used the orthonormality of the basis states. To find the representation of the NOT operator in the <span class="math inline">\(\{|+\rangle,|-\rangle\}\)</span> basis, we need to find the unitary transformation connecting this basis with the standard or computational basis. That is, we need to find a matrix with components given by <span class="math display">\[U_{\text {trans}}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\langle+| 0\rangle &amp; \langle+| 1\rangle \\\langle-| 0\rangle &amp; \langle-| 1\rangle\end{array}\right)\]</span> We know already the representation of the <span class="math inline">\(\{|+\rangle,|-\rangle\}\)</span> states in the standard or computational basis: <span class="math display">\[|+\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\1\end{array}\right), \quad|-\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{c}1 \\-1\end{array}\right)\]</span> So it's a simple matter to compute each matrix component: <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l}\langle+| 0\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1 \quad 1)\left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\0\end{array}\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\\langle+| 1\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1 \quad 1)\left(\begin{array}{l}0 \\1\end{array}\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\\langle-| 0\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1 \quad-1)\left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\0\end{array}\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\\langle-| 1\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1 \quad-1)\left(\begin{array}{l}1 \\0\end{array}\right)=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{array}\]</span> Hence the transformation matrix between the two bases is given by <span class="math display">\[U_{\text {trans}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; -1\end{array}\right)=H\]</span></p><h4 id="hadamard-matrix">Hadamard matrix</h4><p>Hence the transformation matrix between the two bases is given by <span class="math display">\[U_{\text {trans}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; -1\end{array}\right)=H\]</span> This matrix is nothing other than the Hadamard matrix <span class="math inline">\(H .\)</span> For this reason the <span class="math inline">\(\{|+\rangle,|-\rangle\}\)</span> basis is sometimes called the Hadamard basis. Now we can apply this unitary transformation to the matrix representation of the NOT gate to find its representation with respect to the Hadamard basis. It is easy to verify that <span class="math inline">\(H=H^{\dagger}=H^{-1},\)</span> so the unitary transformation that takes NOT from the standard or computational basis to the <strong>Hadamard basis</strong> is just <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}U_{N O T}^{H} &amp;=H U_{N O T} H=\frac{1}{2}\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; -1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}0 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; 0\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; -1\end{array}\right) \\&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; -1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 &amp; -1 \\1 &amp; 1\end{array}\right) \\&amp;=\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; -1\end{array}\right)\end{aligned}\]</span></p><h4 id="example-1">Example</h4><p>A rotation matrix by an angle <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[R(\gamma)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\cos \gamma &amp; -\sin \gamma \\\sin \gamma &amp; \cos \gamma\end{array}\right)\]</span> Describe the action of this operator on a qubit <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle=\cos \theta|0\rangle+\sin \theta|1\rangle\)</span></p><p><strong>Solution</strong></p><p>The rotation matrix acts on the state as follows: <span class="math display">\[R(\gamma)|\psi\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\cos \gamma &amp; -\sin \gamma \\\sin \gamma &amp; \cos \gamma\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}\cos \theta \\\sin \theta\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}\cos \gamma \cos \theta-\sin \gamma \sin \theta \\\sin \gamma \cos \theta+\cos \gamma \sin \theta\end{array}\right)\]</span> Now recall some basic trig identities: <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l}\cos (\alpha+\beta)=\cos \alpha \cos \beta-\sin \alpha \sin \beta \\\sin (\alpha+\beta)=\sin \alpha \cos \beta+\cos \alpha \sin \beta\end{array}\]</span> So the rotated state can be written as <span class="math display">\[\left|\psi^{\prime}\right\rangle=\left(\begin{array}{c}\cos (\gamma+\theta) \\\sin (\gamma+\theta)\end{array}\right)=\cos (\gamma+\theta)|0\rangle+\sin (\gamma+\theta)|1\rangle\]</span></p><h4 id="bloch-sphere">Bloch sphere</h4><p>Consider the Bloch sphere picture.

An equivalent circuit, consisting of two controlled NOT gates and the single-qubit gates <span class="math inline">\(A, B,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C,\)</span> will result in the same output. To illustrate how circuits can be manipulated, we have the common example illustrated in</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20200329181636576.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" alt="image-20200329181636576" style="zoom:50%;" /></p><p>We want to prove that a controlled NOT gate can be written in terms of two Hadamard gates and a controlled Z gate.</p><h4 id="decomposing-cnot-gate">decomposing CNOT gate</h4><p>To derive this result, we start by recalling the resolution of the identity operator in Dirac notation. We denote the projection operators onto the $|1 $ and $|0$ states by <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l}P_{0}=|0\rangle\langle 0| \\P_{1}=|1\rangle\langle 1|\end{array}\]</span> Then we write the identity operator as <span class="math display">\[I=|0\rangle\langle 0|+| 1\rangle\langle 1|=P_{0}+P_{1}\]</span> Now consider the <span class="math inline">\(+X\)</span> state: <span class="math display">\[|+\rangle=\frac{|0\rangle+|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\]</span> The projection operator onto this state is <span class="math display">\[P_{+}=|+\rangle \langle+ |=\frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle\langle 0|+| 0\rangle\langle 1|+| 1\rangle\langle 0|+| 1\rangle\langle 1|) \]</span> Now recall the Dirac notation representations for the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> operators and how they relate <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}X &amp;=|0\rangle\langle 1|+| 1\rangle\langle 0|=P_{+}-P_{-} \\Z &amp;=|0\rangle\langle 0|-| 1\rangle\langle 1|=P_{0}-P_{1}\end{aligned}\]</span></p><h4 id="decomposing-cnot-gate-2">decomposing CNOT gate 2</h4><p>In the exercises you will show that the controlled NOT matrix can be generated from <span class="math inline">\(P_{0} \otimes I+P_{1} \otimes X .\)</span> So we start here and use (8.43): <span class="math display">\[P_{0} \otimes I+P_{1} \otimes X=P_{0} \otimes\left(P_{+}+P_{-}\right)+P_{1} \otimes X\]</span> Next we use ( 8.44 ) to write <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in terms of the same projection operators, giving <span class="math inline">\(P_{0} \otimes\left(P_{+}+P_{-}\right)+P_{1} \otimes\left(P_{+}-P_{-}\right)=\left(P_{0}+P_{1}\right) \otimes P_{+}+\left(P_{0}-P_{1}\right) \otimes P_{-}\)</span> From (8.39) and (8.45) we see that this is just <span class="math display">\[I \otimes P_{+}+\left(P_{0}-P_{1}\right) \otimes P_{-}=I \otimes P_{+}+Z \otimes P_{-}\]</span> From (8.16) in Dirac notation the Hadamard operator is <span class="math display">\[H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle\langle 0|+| 0\rangle\langle 1|+| 1\rangle\langle 0|-| 1\rangle\langle 1|)\]</span> Notice that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}P_{0} H &amp;=(|0\rangle\langle 0|) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle\langle 0|+| 0\rangle\langle 1|+| 1\rangle\langle 0|-| 1\rangle\langle 1|) \\&amp;=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle\langle 0|+| 0\rangle\langle 1|)\end{aligned}\]</span> So we have <span class="math display">\[H P_{0} H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle\langle 0|+| 0\rangle\langle 1|+| 1\rangle\langle 0|-| 1\rangle\langle 1|) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle\langle 0|+| 0\rangle\langle 1|)\]</span></p><p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l}=\frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle\langle 0|+| 0\rangle\langle 1|+| 1\rangle\langle 0|+| 1\rangle\langle 1|) \\=P_{+}\end{array}\]</span></p><p>This means that <span class="math display">\[I \otimes P_{+}=I \otimes H P_{0} H=(I \otimes H)\left(I \otimes P_{0} H\right)=(I \otimes H)\left(I \otimes P_{0}\right)(I \otimes H)\]</span> It can also be shown that <span class="math display">\[Z \otimes P_{-}=(I \otimes H)\left(Z \otimes P_{1}\right)(I \otimes H)\]</span> Putting the two results together, we can rewrite (8.46) as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}I \otimes P_{+}+Z \otimes P_{-} &amp;=(I \otimes H)\left(I \otimes P_{0}\right)(I \otimes H)+(I \otimes H)\left(Z \otimes P_{1}\right)(I \otimes H) \\&amp;=(I \otimes H)\left(I \otimes P_{0}+Z \otimes P_{1}\right)(I \otimes H)\end{aligned}\]</span> This is the circuit shown on the right-hand side of Figure <span class="math inline">\(8.7 .\)</span> What this tells us is to first apply the operation that leaves the first qubit alone and applies a Hadamard gate to the second qubit, then apply the controlled <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> gate, and finally apply another Hadamard gate to the second qubit only.</p>]]></content>

模型的相变则是格点间相互作用使体系位形趋于有序这一因素，与横场导致格点翻转的无序这另一因素间的竞争导致的结果，这是一种描述系统的基本相互作用参量间的竞争，属于<strong>量子相变</strong>。</p><h2 id="经典ising模型">经典ising模型</h2><h4 id="哈密顿量">哈密顿量</h4><p>一维经典 Ising 模型哈密顿量 <span class="math

Each unit cell contains the same (finite) number of atoms arranged in the same geometry. An example is graphene, i.e., a planar structure of <span class="math inline">\(s p^{2}\)</span> -bonded carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice as illustrated in Fig. 2.4. In this case the unit cell consists of two carbon atoms, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in the figure, repeated periodically along the directions <span class="math inline">\(v _{+}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v _{-}\)</span>. The unit cells can be labeled with a vector of integers <span class="math inline">\(n =\left(n_{1}, \ldots, n_{d}\right)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the dimension of the crystal, see again Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2.4 .\)</span> The expansion of the vector <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> over the orthonormal basis <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ e _{i}\right\}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\left( e _{i}\right)_{j}=\delta_{i j}\)</span> reads <span class="math display">\[n =\sum_{i=1}^{d} n_{i} e _{i}\]</span> Two unit cells with labels <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n ^{\prime}\)</span> are nearest neighbor if <span class="math inline">\(\left| n - n ^{\prime}\right|=1 .\)</span> As for the PPP model we assign to each unit cell a set of localized orbitals <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\varphi_{ n s \sigma}\right\}\)</span> which we assume already orthonormal and denote by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{ n s \sigma}^{\dagger}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{ n s \sigma}\)</span>, the creation and annihilation operators for electrons in the orbital <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_{ n s \sigma}\)</span>. The index <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> runs over all orbitals of a given unit cell. In the case of graphene we may assign a single <span class="math inline">\(p_{z}\)</span> orbital to each carbon, so <span class="math inline">\(s=1,2\)</span>.</p><p>In the absence of magnetic fields or other couplings that break the spin symmetry, the matrix elements of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{h}\)</span> are <span class="math display">\[h_{ n s \sigma n ^{\prime} s^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}}=\delta_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}} h_{ n s n ^{\prime} s^{\prime}}\]</span> If we choose orbitals localized around the atomic positions then the matrix elements <span class="math inline">\(h_{ n s n ^{\prime} s^{\prime}}\)</span> are very small for <span class="math inline">\(\left| n - n ^{\prime}\right| \gg 1 .\)</span> We then discard <span class="math inline">\(h_{ n s n ^{\prime} s^{\prime}}\)</span> unless <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n ^{\prime}\)</span> are nearest neighbors. The periodicity of a crystal is reflected in the fact that the unit cell Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(h_{ n s n s^{\prime}},\)</span> as well as the Hamiltonian connecting two nearest neighbor cells <span class="math inline">\(h_{ n s} n \pm e _{i} s^{\prime},\)</span> does not depend on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. We therefore define the matrices <span class="math display">\[h_{s s^{\prime}} \equiv h_{ ns ns ^{\prime}}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}T_{i, s s^{\prime}} \equiv h_{ n + e _{i} s n s^{\prime}}, \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_{i, s s^{\prime}}^{\dagger} &amp;=h_{ n + e _{i} s^{\prime} n s}^{*}=h_{ n s n + e _{i} s^{\prime}} \\&amp;=h_{ n - e _{i} s n s^{\prime}}\end{aligned}\]</span> With these definitions our model for the noninteracting Hamiltonian of a crystal takes the form <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}_{0}=\sum_{ n \sigma} \sum_{s s^{\prime}}\left(h_{s s^{\prime}} \hat{d}_{ n s \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{ n s^{\prime} \sigma}+\sum_{i=1}^{d} T_{i, s s^{\prime}} \hat{d}_{ n + e _{i} s \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{ n s^{\prime} \sigma}+T_{i, s s^{\prime}}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{ n - e _{i} s \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{ n s^{\prime} \sigma}\right)\]</span> To better visualize the matrix structure of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> we introduce the vector of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> -operators <span class="math display">\[\hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}^{\dagger} \equiv\left(\hat{d}_{ n 1 \sigma}^{\dagger}, \hat{d}_{ n 2 \sigma}^{\dagger}, \ldots\right), \quad \hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}=\left(\hat{d}_{ n 1 \sigma}^{\dagger}, \hat{d}_{ n 2 \sigma}^{\dagger}, \ldots\right)^{\dagger}\]</span> and rewrite <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> in terms of the product between these vectors and the matrices <span class="math inline">\(h, T_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{i}^{\dagger}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}_{0}=\sum_{ n \sigma}\left(\hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}^{\dagger} h \hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}+\sum_{i=1}^{d} \hat{ d }_{ n + e _{i} \sigma}^{\dagger} T_{i} \hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}+\hat{ d }_{ n - e _{i} \sigma}^{\dagger} T_{i}^{\dagger} \hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}\right)\]</span> The strategy to find the one-particle eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> consists of considering a finite block of the crystal and then letting the volume of the block go to infinity. This block is, for convenience, chosen as a parallelepiped with edges given by <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> linearly independent vectors of integers <span class="math inline">\(N _{1}, \ldots, N _{d}\)</span> each radiating from a given unit cell. Without loss of generality we can choose the radiating unit cell at the origin. The set <span class="math inline">\(V _{b}\)</span> of all unit cells contained in the block is then <span class="math display">\[V _{b}=\left\{ n : \frac{ n \cdot N _{i}}{ N _{i} \cdot N _{i}}&lt;1 \text { for all } i\right\}\]</span> In the case of a one-dimensional crystal we can choose only one vector <span class="math inline">\(N _{1}=N\)</span> and the unit cells of the block <span class="math inline">\(n =n \in V _{b}\)</span> are those with <span class="math inline">\(n=0,1, \ldots, N-1\)</span>. For the two-dimensional graphene, instead, we may choose, e.g., <span class="math inline">\(N _{1}=(N, 0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N _{2}=(0, M)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(N _{1}=(N, N)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N _{2}=(M,-M)\)</span> or any other couple of linearly independent vectors. When the volume of the block tends to infinity the eigenvalues of the crystal are independent of the choice of the block. Interestingly, however, the procedure below allows us to know the eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> for any finite <span class="math inline">\(N _{1}, \ldots, N _{d},\)</span> and hence to have access to the eigenvalues of blocks of different shapes. We come back to this aspect at the end of the section. To simplify the mathematical treatment we impose periodic boundary conditions along <span class="math inline">\(N _{1}, \ldots, N _{d}\)</span>, i.e., we "wrap" the block onto itself forming a ring in <span class="math inline">\(d=1\)</span>, a torus in <span class="math inline">\(d=2\)</span>, etc. This choice of boundary conditions is known as the Born-von Karman (BvK) boundary condition and turns out to be very convenient. Other kinds of boundary condition would lead to the same results in the limit of large <span class="math inline">\(V _{b}\)</span>. The Bvk condition implies that the cells <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n + N _{i}\)</span> are actually the same cell and we therefore make the identifications <span class="math display">\[\hat{ d }_{ n + N _{i} \sigma}^{\dagger} \equiv \hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}^{\dagger}, \quad \hat{ d }_{ n + N _{i} \sigma} \equiv \hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}\]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(N _{i}\)</span>. We are now in the position to show how the diagonalization procedure works. Consider the Hamiltonian (2.8) in which the sum over <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is restricted to unit cells in <span class="math inline">\(V _{b}\)</span> and the identification (2.10) holds for all boundary terms with one <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> -operator outside <span class="math inline">\(V _{b}\)</span>. To bring <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> into a diagonal form we must find a suitable linear combination of the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> -operators that preserves the anti-commutation relations, as discussed in Section <span class="math inline">\(1.6 .\)</span> For this purpose we construct the matrix <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> with elements <span class="math display">\[U_{ nk }=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left| V _{b}\right|}} e^{ ik \cdot n }\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\left| V _{b}\right|\)</span> is the number of unit cells in <span class="math inline">\(V _{b} .\)</span> In (2.11) the row index runs over all <span class="math inline">\(n \in V _{b}\)</span> whereas the column index runs over all vectors <span class="math inline">\(k =\left(k_{1}, \ldots, k_{d}\right)\)</span> with components <span class="math inline">\(-\pi&lt;\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(k_{i} \leq \pi\)</span> and, more importantly, fulfilling <span class="math display">\[k \cdot N _{i}=2 \pi m_{i}, \quad \text { with } m_{i} \text { integers. }\]</span> We leave it as an exercise for the reader to prove that the number of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> vectors with these properties is exactly <span class="math inline">\(\left| V _{b}\right|\)</span> and hence that <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is a square matrix. Due to property (2.12) the quantity <span class="math inline">\(U_{ nk }\)</span> is periodic in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> with periods <span class="math inline">\(N _{1}, \ldots, N _{d}\)</span>. It is this periodicity that we now exploit to prove that <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is unitary. Consider the following set of equalities and the likes with <span class="math inline">\(k_{2}^{\prime}, \ldots, k_{d}^{\prime} .\)</span> In the second line of the above identities we use the fact that the sum over all <span class="math inline">\(n \in V _{b}\)</span> of a periodic function <span class="math inline">\(f( n )\)</span> is the same as the sum of <span class="math inline">\(f\left( n - e _{1}\right)\)</span>. For the left and the right hand side of these equations to be the same we must either have <span class="math inline">\(k = k ^{\prime}\)</span> or <span class="math display">\[\sum_{ n } U_{ n k }^{*} U_{ n k ^{\prime}}=0 \quad \text { for } k \neq k ^{\prime}\]</span> Since for <span class="math inline">\(k = k ^{\prime}\)</span> the sum <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{ n } U_{ n k }^{*} U_{ n k }=1\)</span>, the matrix <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is unitary and hence the operators <span class="math display">\[\hat{ c }_{ k \sigma}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left| V _{b}\right|}} \sum_{ n \in V _{b}} e^{- i k \cdot n } \hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}, \quad \hat{ c }_{ k \sigma}^{\dagger}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left| v _{b}\right|}} \sum_{ n \in V _{b}} e^{ i k \cdot n } \hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}^{\dagger}\]</span> preserve the anti-commutation relations. The inverse relations read <span class="math display">\[\hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left| V _{b}\right|}} \sum_{ k } e^{i k \cdot n } \hat{ c }_{ k \sigma}, \quad \hat{ d }_{ n \sigma}^{\dagger}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left| V _{b}\right|}} \sum_{ k } e^{- i k \cdot n } \hat{ c }_{ k \sigma}^{\dagger}\]</span> and the reader can easily check that due to property (2.12) the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> -operators satisfy the BvK boundary conditions (2.10). Inserting these inverse relations into (2.8) (in which the sum is restricted to <span class="math inline">\(n \in V _{b}\)</span> ) we get the Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}_{0}=\sum_{ k \sigma} \hat{ c }_{ k \sigma}^{\dagger}\left(h+\sum_{i=1}^{d}\left(T_{i} e^{- i k_{i}}+T_{i}^{\dagger} e^{ i k_{i}}\right)\right) \hat{ c }_{ k \sigma}\]</span> In this expression the matrix <span class="math inline">\(h_{ k }\)</span> is Hermitian and can be diagonalized. Let <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k \nu}\)</span> be the eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(h_{ k }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_{ k }\)</span> be the unitary matrix that brings <span class="math inline">\(h_{ k }\)</span> into the diagonal form, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(h_{ k }=u_{ k } \operatorname{diag}\left(\epsilon_{ k 1}, \epsilon_{ k 2}, \ldots\right) u_{ k }^{\dagger} .\)</span> The unitary matrix <span class="math inline">\(u_{ k }\)</span> has the dimension of the number of orbitals in the unit cell and should not be confused with the matrix <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> whose dimension is <span class="math inline">\(\left| V _{b}\right| .\)</span> We now perform a further change of basis and construct the following linear combinations of the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{c}\)</span> -operators with fixed <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> vector <span class="math display">\[\hat{ b }_{ k \sigma}=u_{ k }^{\dagger} \hat{ c }_{ k \sigma}, \quad \hat{ b }_{ k \sigma}^{\dagger}=\hat{ c }_{ k \sigma}^{\dagger} u_{ k }\]</span> Denoting by <span class="math inline">\(u_{ k \nu}(s)=\left(u_{ k }\right)_{s \nu}\)</span> the <span class="math inline">\((s, \nu)\)</span> matrix element of <span class="math inline">\(u_{ k }\)</span> the explicit form of the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{b}\)</span> -operators is <span class="math display">\[\hat{b}_{ k \nu \sigma}=\sum_{s} u_{ k \nu}^{*}(s) \hat{c}_{ k s \sigma}, \quad \hat{b}_{ k \nu \sigma}^{\dagger}=\sum_{s} u_{ k \nu}(s) \hat{c}_{ k s \sigma}^{\dagger}\]</span> With these definitions the Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> takes the desired form since <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\hat{H}_{0} &amp;=\sum_{ k \sigma} \hat{ c }_{ k \sigma}^{\dagger} u_{ k } \operatorname{diag}\left(\epsilon_{ k 1}, \epsilon_{ k 2}, \ldots\right) u_{ k }^{\dagger} \hat{ c }_{ k \sigma} \\&amp;=\sum_{ k \nu \sigma} \epsilon_{ k \nu} \hat{b}_{ k \nu \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{b}_{ k \nu \sigma}\end{aligned}\]</span> We have derived the Bloch theorem: the one-particle eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> are obtained by diagonalizing <span class="math inline">\(h_{ k }\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and the corresponding one-particle eigenkets <span class="math inline">\(| k \nu \sigma\rangle=\hat{b}_{ k \nu \sigma}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\)</span> have overlap with the original basis functions <span class="math inline">\(\left| n s \sigma^{\prime}\right\rangle=d_{n s \sigma^{\prime}}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\)</span> given by <span class="math display">\[\psi_{ k \nu \sigma}\left( n s \sigma^{\prime}\right)=\left\langle n s \sigma^{\prime} \mid k \nu \sigma\right\rangle=\frac{\delta_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}}}{\sqrt{\left| V _{b}\right|}} e^{i k \cdot n } u_{ k \nu}(s)\]</span> which is a plane-wave with different amplitudes on different atoms of the same unit cell. When the volume of the block <span class="math inline">\(\left| V _{b}\right| \rightarrow \infty\)</span> the eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k \nu}\)</span> become a continuum called a band. <span class="math inline">\(^{3}\)</span> We then have a band for each <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> and the total number of bands coincides with the number of localized orbitals per unit cell. Each crystal is characterized by its band structure and, as we see in Section 6.3 .4 , the band structure can be experimentally measured. If we choose the localized basis functions to be of the form (2.1) and subsequently we want to increase the accuracy of the calculations by reducing the spacing <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, then in the limit <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rightarrow 0\)</span> the quantities <span class="math inline">\(u_{ k \nu}(s) \rightarrow u_{ k \nu}( r )\)</span> become continuous functions of the position <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> in the cell. These functions can be periodically extended to all space by imposing a requirement that they assume the same value in the same point of all unit cells. In the literature the periodic functions <span class="math inline">\(u_{ k \nu}( r )\)</span> are called Bloch functions. Below we illustrate some elementary applications of this general framework.</p><h3 id="one-band-model">One-band model</h3><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210108173539787.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><blockquote><p>Figure 2.5 (a) A ring with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> unit cells.

In this situation we must provide a minimum energy <span class="math inline">\(2 \Delta\)</span> to excite one electron in an empty state; the crystal behaves like an insulator if the gap is large and like a semiconductor if the gap is small. It is also worth noting that for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=0\)</span> we recover the previous example but with <span class="math inline">\(2 N\)</span> atoms rather than <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p><h3 id="graphene">Graphene</h3><p>Another important example that we wish to discuss is the two-dimensional crystal with which we opened this section. Graphene is a single layer of graphite and, as such, not easy to isolate. It was not until 2004 that graphene was experimentally realized by transferring a single layer of graphite onto a silicon dioxide substrate [9] , an achievement which was rewarded with the Nobel prize in physics in <span class="math inline">\(2010 .\)</span> The coupling between the graphene and the substrate is very weak and does not alter the electrical properties of the graphene. Before 2004 experimentalists were already able to produce tubes of graphene with a diameter of few nanometers. These carbon nanotubes can be considered as an infinitely long graphene strip wrapped onto a cylinder. Due to their mechanical (strong and stiff) and electrical properties, carbon nanotubes are among the most studied systems at the time of writing this book. There exist several kinds of nanotube depending on how the strip is wrapped. The wrapping is specified by a pair of integers <span class="math inline">\((P, Q)\)</span> so that atoms separated by <span class="math inline">\(P_{ V _{+}}+Q_{ v -}\)</span> are identified. Below we consider the armchair nanotubes for which <span class="math inline">\((P, Q)=(N, N)\)</span> and hence the axis of the tube is parallel to <span class="math inline">\(v _{+}- v _{-}\)</span></p><p>Let us define the vector <span class="math inline">\(N _{1}=(N, N)\)</span> and the vector parallel to the tube axis <span class="math inline">\(N _{2}=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\((M,-M)\)</span>. The armchair nanotube is recovered when <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. For simplicity we assign a single <span class="math inline">\(p_{z}\)</span> orbital to each carbon atom and consider only those off-diagonal matrix elements that connect atoms <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to atoms <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. From Fig. 2.4 we then see that the matrices <span class="math inline">\(h, T_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{2}\)</span> must have the form <span class="math inline">\(^{4}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[h=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0 &amp; t \\t &amp; 0\end{array}\right), \quad T_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0 &amp; t \\0 &amp; 0\end{array}\right), \quad T_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0 &amp; t \\0 &amp; 0\end{array}\right)\]</span> The eigenvalues of <span class="math display">\[h_{ k }=h+\sum_{i=1}^{2}\left(T_{i} e^{-i k_{i}}+T_{i}^{\dagger} e^{i k_{i}}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0 &amp; t\left(1+e^{-i k_{1}}+e^{-i k_{2}}\right) \\t\left(1+e^{i k_{1}}+e^{i k_{2}}\right) &amp; 0\end{array}\right)\]</span> can easily be calculated and read <span class="math display">\[\epsilon_{ k \pm}=\pm t \sqrt{1+4 \cos \frac{k_{1}-k_{2}}{2}\left(\cos \frac{k_{1}-k_{2}}{2}+\cos \frac{k_{1}+k_{2}}{2}\right)}\]</span> The possible values of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> belong to a square with vertices in <span class="math inline">\((\pm \pi, \pm \pi)\)</span> and fulfill (2.12), i.e., <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l} k \cdot N _{1}=N\left(k_{1}+k_{2}\right)=2 \pi m_{1} \\k \cdot N _{2}=M\left(k_{1}-k_{2}\right)=2 \pi m_{2}\end{array}\]</span> <img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210108173829490.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><blockquote><p>Figure 2.7 (a) Equivalent domain of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> vectors.

Since the neutral nanotube has one electron per atom, all bands with negative energy are fully occupied. It is noteworthy that the highest occupied band (valence band) and the lowest unoccupied band (conduction band) touch only in two points. Around these points the energy dispersion is linear and the electrons behave as if they were relativistic [10] . Increasing the diameter of the nanotube also, <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}\)</span> becomes a continuous index and the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{k \pm}\)</span> become the eigenvalues of the two-dimensional graphene. In this limit the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ k \pm}\)</span> form two two-dimensional bands which still touch in only two points. Due to its so peculiar band structure graphene is classified as a semi-metal, that is a crystal with properties between a metal and a semiconductor.</p><h2 id="fano-model">Fano model</h2><p>The Fano model is ubiquitous in condensed matter physics as it represents the simplest schematization of a discrete state "interacting" with a continuum of states. It was originally introduced by Fano to explain a universal asymmetric line-shape observed in the absorption spectrum of several physical systems [14]. We introduce it here to model an atom or a molecule adsorbed on the surface of a metal, see the schematic illustration below.</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210108174022836.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(|\epsilon Q\rangle\)</span> be the single-particle energy eigenket of the metal, where <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is a quantum number (continuous or discrete) that accounts for the degeneracy of the eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. In this section the spin index carried by states and operators is understood since everything is diagonal in spin space. Equivalently, we can think of fermions with spin zero. For the atom we consider only a single localized orbital and denote by <span class="math inline">\(\left|\epsilon_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> the corresponding ket. For large distances between the atom and the surface the Hamiltonian of the system is the sum of the Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{\text {met }}\)</span> of the metal and the Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{\text {at }}\)</span> of the atom <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}_{ met }+\hat{H}_{ at }=\int d \epsilon d Q \epsilon \hat{d}_{\epsilon Q}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{\epsilon Q}+\epsilon_{0} \hat{d}_{0}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{0}\]</span> where the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> -operators create or annihilate electrons and hence satisfy the anti-commutation relations <span class="math display">\[\left[\hat{d}_{\epsilon Q}, \hat{d}_{\epsilon^{\prime} Q^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\right]_{+}=\delta\left(\epsilon-\epsilon^{\prime}\right) \delta\left(Q-Q^{\prime}\right), \quad\left[\hat{d}_{0}, \hat{d}_{0}^{\dagger}\right]_{+}=1\]</span> When the atom approaches the surface the overlap <span class="math inline">\(T_{\epsilon Q} \equiv\left\langle\epsilon Q|\hat{h}| \epsilon_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> increases and cannot be neglected any longer. In this regime the Hamiltonian of the system becomes <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}_{0}=\hat{H}_{ met }+\hat{H}_{ at }+\int d \epsilon d Q\left(T_{\epsilon Q} \hat{d}_{\epsilon Q}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{0}+T_{\epsilon Q}^{*} \hat{d}_{0}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{\epsilon Q}\right)\]</span> This is the general structure of the Fano model. It is common (and for later purposes also instructive) to discretize the continuum of states by retaining only one state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\epsilon_{k} Q_{k}\right\rangle\)</span> in the volume element <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \epsilon \Delta Q\)</span>. Then, for small volume elements the Fano Hamiltonian can be approximated as <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}_{0}=\sum_{k} \epsilon_{k} \hat{d}_{k}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{k}+\epsilon_{0} \hat{d}_{0}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{0}+\sum_{k}\left(T_{k} \hat{d}_{k}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{0}+T_{k}^{*} \hat{d}_{0}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{k}\right)\]</span> where the discrete <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> -operators satisfy the anti-commutation relations <span class="math inline">\(\left[\hat{d}_{k}, \hat{d}_{k^{\prime}}\right]_{+}=\delta_{k k^{\prime}} .\)</span> To recover the continuum limit we establish the correspondence <span class="math display">\[T_{k}=\sqrt{\Delta \epsilon \Delta Q} T_{\epsilon_{k} Q_{k}}\]</span> for the off-diagonal matrix elements of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{h}\)</span>, and <span class="math display">\[\hat{d}_{k}=\sqrt{\Delta \epsilon \Delta Q} \hat{d}_{\epsilon_{k} Q_{k}}, \quad \hat{d}_{k}^{\dagger}=\sqrt{\Delta \epsilon \Delta Q} \hat{d}_{\epsilon_{k} Q_{k}}^{\dagger}\]</span> for the fermionic operators. Letting <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \epsilon \Delta Q \rightarrow 0\)</span> the discrete Hamiltonian (2.18) reduces to the continuum Hamiltonian (2.17) and <span class="math display">\[\left[\hat{d}_{\epsilon_{k} Q_{k}}, \hat{d}_{\epsilon_{k^{\prime}} Q_{k^{\prime}}}^{\dagger}\right]_{+}=\frac{\delta_{k k^{\prime}}}{\Delta \epsilon \Delta Q} \rightarrow \delta\left(\epsilon-\epsilon^{\prime}\right) \delta\left(Q-Q^{\prime}\right)\]</span> We now calculate the atomic occupation <span class="math inline">\(n_{0}\)</span> for a given Fermi energy <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ F }\)</span>, which is the energy of the highest occupied level of the metal. Let <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda\rangle\)</span> be the single-particle eigenkets of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> with eigenenergies <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\lambda}\)</span>. The corresponding annihilation and creation operators <span class="math inline">\(\hat{c}_{\lambda}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{c}_{\lambda}^{\dagger}\)</span> are a linear combination of the original <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> -operators as discussed in Section 1.5 , <span class="math display">\[\hat{c}_{\lambda}^{\dagger}=\left\langle\epsilon_{0} \mid \lambda\right\rangle \hat{d}_{0}^{\dagger}+\sum_{k}\langle k \mid \lambda\rangle \hat{d}_{k}^{\dagger}\]</span> and with a similar equation for the adjoint. The ground state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Phi_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> of the system is obtained by occupying all the <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda\rangle\)</span> s with energies <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\lambda} \leq \epsilon_{ F }\)</span> and reads <span class="math display">\[\left|\Phi_{0}\right\rangle=\prod_{\lambda: \epsilon_{\lambda} \leq \epsilon_{F}} \hat{c}_{\lambda}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\]</span> To calculate the atomic occupation <span class="math inline">\(n_{0}=\left\langle\Phi_{0}\left|\hat{d}_{0}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{0}\right| \Phi_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> we evaluate the ket <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{0}\left|\Phi_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> by moving the operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{0}\)</span> through the string of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{c}^{\dagger}\)</span> -operators, as we did in (1.57). The difference here is that the anti-commutator is <span class="math inline">\(\left[\hat{d}_{0}, \hat{c}_{\lambda}^{\dagger}\right]_{+}=\left\langle\epsilon_{0} \mid \lambda\right\rangle\)</span> rather than a Kronecker delta. We then find <span class="math display">\[\hat{d}_{0}\left|\Phi_{0}\right\rangle=\sum_{\lambda}(-)^{p_{\lambda}}\left\langle\epsilon_{0} \mid \lambda\right\rangle \prod_{\lambda^{\prime} \neq \lambda} \hat{c}_{\lambda^{\prime}}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\]</span> where the sum and the product are restricted to states below the Fermi energy. The integer <span class="math inline">\(p_{\lambda}\)</span> in the above equation refers to the position of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{c}_{\lambda}^{\dagger}\)</span> in the string of operators (2.20) in agreement with (1.57). The atomic occupation <span class="math inline">\(n_{0}\)</span> is the inner product of the manyparticle state <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{0}\left|\Phi_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> with itself. In this inner product all cross terms vanish since they are proportional to the inner product of states with different strings of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{c}_{\lambda}^{\dagger}\)</span> operators, see (1.58). Taking into account that <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{\lambda^{\prime} \neq \lambda} \hat{c}_{\lambda^{\prime}}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\)</span> is normalized to 1 for every <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> we obtain the intuitive result <span class="math display">\[n_{0}=\sum_{\lambda: \epsilon_{\lambda} \leq \epsilon_{F}}\left|\left\langle\epsilon_{0} \mid \lambda\right\rangle\right|^{2}\]</span> the atomic occupation is the sum over all occupied states of the probability of finding an electron in <span class="math inline">\(\left|\epsilon_{0}\right\rangle .\)</span></p><p>From (2.21) it seems that we need to know the eigenkets <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda\rangle\)</span> and eigenenergies <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{\lambda}\)</span> in order to determine <span class="math inline">\(n_{0}\)</span>. We now show that this is not strictly the case. Let us rewrite <span class="math inline">\(n_{0}\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[n_{0}=\int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_{ F }} \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi} \sum_{\lambda} 2 \pi \delta\left(\omega-\epsilon_{\lambda}\right)\left|\left\langle\epsilon_{0} \mid \lambda\right\rangle\right|^{2}\]</span> The eigenkets <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda\rangle\)</span> satisfy <span class="math inline">\(\hat{h}|\lambda\rangle=\epsilon_{\lambda}|\lambda\rangle\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{h}\)</span> is the one-particle Hamiltonian in first quantization. For the Fano model <span class="math inline">\(\hat{h}\)</span> has the following ket-bra form: <span class="math display">\[\hat{h}=\sum_{k} \epsilon_{k}|k\rangle\left\langle k\left|+\epsilon_{0}\right| \epsilon_{0}\right\rangle\left\langle\epsilon_{0}\right|+\sum_{k}\left(T_{k}|k\rangle\left\langle\epsilon_{0}\left|+T_{k}^{*}\right| \epsilon_{0}\right\rangle\langle k|\right)\]</span> where we use (1.86) . Then <span class="math display">\[\sum_{\lambda} \delta\left(\omega-\epsilon_{\lambda}\right)\left|\left\langle\epsilon_{0} \mid \lambda\right\rangle\right|^{2}=\sum_{\lambda}\left\langle\epsilon_{0}|\delta(\omega-\hat{h})| \lambda\right\rangle\left\langle\lambda \mid \epsilon_{0}\right\rangle=\left\langle\epsilon_{0}|\delta(\omega-\hat{h})| \epsilon_{0}\right\rangle\]</span> where we use the completeness relation <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{\lambda}|\lambda\rangle\langle\lambda|=\hat{ 1 }\)</span>. Inserting this result into (2.22) we get <span class="math display">\[n_{0}=\int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_{ F }} \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi}\left\langle\epsilon_{0}|2 \pi \delta(\omega-\hat{h})| \epsilon_{0}\right\rangle\]</span> This is our first encounter with the spectral function (first quantization) operator <span class="math display">\[\hat{ A }(\omega) \equiv 2 \pi \delta(\omega-\hat{h})= i \left[\frac{1}{\omega-\hat{h}+ i \eta}-\frac{1}{\omega-\hat{h}- i \eta}\right]\]</span> In the second equality <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> is an infinitesimally small positive constant and we used the Cauchy relation <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{\omega-\epsilon \pm i \eta}=P \frac{1}{\omega-\epsilon} \mp i \pi \delta(\omega-\epsilon)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> denotes the principal part. Thus we can calculate <span class="math inline">\(n_{0}\)</span> if we find a way to determine the matrix element <span class="math inline">\(A_{00}(\omega)=\left\langle\epsilon_{0}|\hat{ A }(\omega)| \epsilon_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> of the spectral function. As we see in Chapter 6 , this matrix element can be interpreted as the probability that an electron in <span class="math inline">\(\left|\epsilon_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> has energy <span class="math inline">\(\omega^{6}\)</span> To determine <span class="math inline">\(A_{00}(\omega)\)</span> we separate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{h}=\hat{ E }+\hat{ T }\)</span> into a sum of the metal+atom Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{ E }\)</span> and the off-diagonal part <span class="math inline">\(\hat{ T },\)</span> and use the identity <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{\zeta-\hat{h}}=\frac{1}{\zeta-\hat{ E }}+\frac{1}{\zeta-\hat{h}} \hat{ T } \frac{1}{\zeta-\hat{ E }}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\zeta\)</span> is an arbitrary complex number.

In conclusion, we have obtained an expression for <span class="math inline">\(n_{0}\)</span> in terms of the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(\omega)\)</span> only <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}n_{0} &amp;=\int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_{ F }} \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi} A_{00}(\omega) \\&amp;=\int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_{ F }} \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi} i \left[\frac{1}{\omega+ i \eta-\epsilon_{0}-\Sigma_{ em }(\omega+ i \eta)}-\frac{1}{\omega- i \eta-\epsilon_{0}-\Sigma_{ em }(\omega- i \eta)}\right] \\&amp;=-2 \int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_{ F }} \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi} \operatorname{Im} \frac{1}{\omega-\epsilon_{0}-\Lambda(\omega)+\frac{i}{2} \Gamma(\omega)+ i \eta}\end{aligned}\]</span> If the coupling <span class="math inline">\(T_{k}\)</span> between the atom and the metal is weak then <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> are small and the dominant contribution to the above integral comes from a region around <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{0}\)</span>. In the continuum limit the function <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(\omega)\)</span> is a smooth function since <span class="math display">\[\Gamma(\omega) \rightarrow 2 \pi \int d \epsilon d Q\left|T_{\epsilon Q}\right|^{2} \delta(\omega-\epsilon)=2 \pi \int d Q\left|T_{\omega Q}\right|^{2}\]</span> and in the integral (2.27) we can approximate <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(\omega)\)</span> by a constant <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma=\Gamma\left(\epsilon_{0}\right)\)</span>. This approximation is known as the Wide Band Limit Approximation (WBLA) since for the r.h.s. of (2.28) to be <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> independent the spectrum of the metal must extend from <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>. For a <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(\omega)=\Gamma\)</span> independent of <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> the Hilbert transform <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda(\omega)\)</span> vanishes and the formula for the atomic occupation simplifies to <span class="math inline">\({ }^{7}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[n_{0}=\int_{-\infty}^{\epsilon_{ F }} \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi} \frac{\Gamma}{\left(\omega-\epsilon_{0}\right)^{2}+\Gamma^{2} / 4}\]</span> We thus see that in the WBLA <span class="math inline">\(n_{0}\)</span> is the integral up to the Fermi energy of a Lorentzian of width <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> centered at <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{0}\)</span>. The atomic level is occupied <span class="math inline">\(\left(n_{0} \sim 1\right)\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{0}&lt;\epsilon_{ F }+\Gamma\)</span>, whereas it is empty <span class="math inline">\(\left(n_{0} \sim 0\right)\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{0}&gt;\epsilon_{ F }+\Gamma\)</span>. This result should be compared with the atomic limit, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma=0\)</span>, corresponding to the isolated atom. In this limit the Lorentzian becomes a <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> -function since <span class="math display">\[\lim _{\Gamma \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\Gamma / 2}{\left(\omega-\epsilon_{0}\right)^{2}+\Gamma^{2} / 4}=\delta\left(\omega-\epsilon_{0}\right)\]</span> as follows immediately from the Cauchy relation (2.23). In the atomic limit the atomic occupation is exactly 1 for <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{0}&lt;\epsilon_{ F }\)</span> and zero otherwise. We say that the presence of the metal broadens the sharp atomic level and transforms it into a resonance of finite width as illustrated in Fig. <span class="math inline">\(2.8 .\)</span> This broadening is a general feature of discrete levels "interacting" or "in contact" with a continuum and it is observed in interacting systems as well.</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210108174448715.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><blockquote><p>Figure 2.8 (a) The metallic band and the sharp level in the atomic limit.

For this reason Hubbard, in a milestone paper from 1963 [15], included only the diagonal interaction <span class="math inline">\(U_{s}\)</span> in his treatment and wrote the model Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}=\hat{H}_{0}+\hat{H}_{ int }=\sum_{\sigma} \sum_{s s^{\prime}} h_{s s^{\prime}} \hat{d}_{s \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{s^{\prime} \sigma}+\sum_{s} U_{s} \hat{n}_{s \uparrow} \hat{n}_{s \downarrow}\]</span> that today carries his name. In this Hamiltonian the sums run over the lattice position <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> of the nuclei, the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> -operators are fermionic annihilation and creation operators for electrons with the usual anti-commutation relations <span class="math display">\[\left[\hat{d}_{s \sigma}, \hat{d}_{s^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\right]_{+}=\delta_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}} \delta_{s s^{\prime}}, \quad\left[\hat{d}_{s \sigma}, \hat{d}_{s^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}}\right]_{+}=0\]</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}_{s \sigma}=\hat{d}_{s \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{s \sigma}\)</span> is the occupation operator for electrons in <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> with spin <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. The matrix elements <span class="math inline">\(h_{s s^{\prime}}\)</span> are typically set to zero if the distance between <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s^{\prime}\)</span> exceeds a few lattice spacings. In the context of model Hamiltonians the off-diagonal matrix elements <span class="math inline">\(h_{s s^{\prime}}\)</span> are also called hopping integrals or simply hoppings since they multiply the operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{s \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{s^{\prime} \sigma}\)</span>, which destroys an electron in <span class="math inline">\(s^{\prime}\)</span> and creates an electron in <span class="math inline">\(s,\)</span> an operation that can be pictured as the hopping of an electron from <span class="math inline">\(s^{\prime}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. It is interesting to note that in the Hubbard model two electrons interact only if they occupy the same atomic site (and of course have opposite spins).</p><p>To gain some insight into the physics of the Hubbard model we compare two limiting situations, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{\text {int }}=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}=0 .\)</span> We see that electrons behave as "waves" if <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{\text {int }}=0\)</span> and as "particles" if <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}=0\)</span>; how they behave when both <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{\text {int }}\)</span> are nonzero is a fascinating problem intimately related to wave-particle dualism. To readers interested in the physics of the Hubbard model we suggest the review article in Ref. [16] and the books in Refs. [17,18].</p><p>For <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{\text {int }}=0\)</span> the Hubbard Hamiltonian describes noninteracting electrons on a lattice. Let <span class="math inline">\(|k \sigma\rangle=c_{k \sigma}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\)</span> be the one-particle eigenkets with energies <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{k} .\)</span> If we order the energies <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{k} \leq \epsilon_{k+1}\)</span>, the state of lowest energy with <span class="math inline">\(N_{\uparrow / \downarrow}\)</span> electrons of spin up/down is <span class="math display">\[|\Phi\rangle=\prod_{k=1}^{N_{\uparrow}} \prod_{k^{\prime}=1}^{N_{\downarrow}} \hat{c}_{k \uparrow}^{\dagger} \hat{c}_{k^{\prime} \downarrow}^{\dagger}|0\rangle \quad \text { with } \quad \hat{H}_{0}|\Phi\rangle=\left(\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\uparrow}} \epsilon_{k}+\sum_{k^{\prime}=1}^{N_{\downarrow}} \epsilon_{k^{\prime}}\right)|\Phi\rangle\]</span> We can say that in <span class="math inline">\(|\Phi\rangle\)</span> the electrons behave as "waves" since they have probability 0 or 1 of being in a delocalized state <span class="math inline">\(|k \sigma\rangle .\)</span> The <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> -particle ground state of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> is obtained by minimizing the eigenvalue in (2.30) with respect to <span class="math inline">\(N_{\uparrow}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_{\downarrow}\)</span> under the constraint <span class="math inline">\(N_{\uparrow}+N_{\downarrow}=N\)</span>. For nondegenerate energies <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{k}&lt;\epsilon_{k+1}\)</span>, the ground state of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> with an even number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of electrons is unique and reads <span class="math display">\[\left|\Phi_{0}\right\rangle=\prod_{k=1}^{N / 2} \hat{c}_{k \uparrow}^{\dagger} \hat{c}_{k \downarrow}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\]</span> We leave it as an exercise for the reader to show that <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Phi_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> is also an eigenstate of the total spin operators [see (1.92)], <span class="math display">\[\hat{ S }=\left(\hat{S}^{x}, \hat{S}^{y}, \hat{S}^{z}\right) \equiv \sum_{s} \hat{ S }_{s}=\sum_{s}\left(\hat{S}_{s}^{x}, \hat{S}_{s}^{y}, \hat{S}_{s}^{z}\right)\]</span> with vanishing eigenvalue, i.e., it is a singlet. If we perturb the system with a weak external magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> along, say, the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> axis and discard the coupling to the orbital motion, the noninteracting part of the Hamiltonian changes to <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}_{0} \rightarrow \hat{H}_{0}-g \mu_{ B } \hat{ S } \cdot B =\hat{H}_{0}-\frac{1}{2} g \mu_{ B } B\left(\hat{N}_{\uparrow}-\hat{N}_{\downarrow}\right)\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> the electron gyromagnetic ratio, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{ B }\)</span> the Bohr magneton, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{N}_{\sigma}=\sum_{s} \hat{n}_{s \sigma}\)</span> the operator for the total number of particles of spin <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. The eigenkets (2.30) are also eigenkets of this new Hamiltonian but with a different eigenvalue <span class="math display">\[\left(\hat{H}_{0}-g \mu_{ B } \hat{ S } \cdot B \right)|\Phi\rangle=\left(\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\uparrow}}\left(\epsilon_{k}-\frac{1}{2} g \mu_{ B } B\right)+\sum_{k^{\prime}=1}^{N_{\downarrow}}\left(\epsilon_{k^{\prime}}+\frac{1}{2} g \mu_{ B } B\right)\right)|\Phi\rangle\]</span> Thus, in the presence of an external magnetic field the state (2.31) is no longer the lowest in energy since for, e.g., <span class="math inline">\(B&gt;0,\)</span> it becomes energetically convenient to have more electrons of spin up than of spin down. This is the typical behavior of a Pauli paramagnet, that is a system whose total spin is zero for <span class="math inline">\(B=0\)</span> and grows parallel to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(B \neq 0 .\)</span></p><p>Next we discuss the case <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}=0\)</span>. The Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{\text {int }}\)</span> is already in a diagonal form and the generic eigenket can be written as <span class="math display">\[\left|\Phi_{X Y}\right\rangle=\prod_{s \in X} \prod_{s^{\prime} \in Y} \hat{d}_{s \uparrow}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{s^{\prime} \downarrow}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are two arbitrary collections of atomic sites. We can say that in <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Phi_{X Y}\right\rangle\)</span> the electrons behave like "particles" since they have probability 0 or 1 of being on a given atomic site. The energy eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Phi_{X Y}\right\rangle\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[E_{X Y}=\sum_{s \in X \cap Y} U_{s}\]</span> The ground state(s) for a given number <span class="math inline">\(N=N_{\uparrow}+N_{\downarrow}\)</span> of electrons can be constructed by choosing <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> that minimize the energy <span class="math inline">\(E_{X Y}\)</span>. Denoting by <span class="math inline">\(N_{ V }\)</span> the total number of atomic sites, we have that for <span class="math inline">\(N \leq N_{ V }\)</span> all states with <span class="math inline">\(X \cap Y=\emptyset\)</span> are ground states (with zero energy) and, again, the system behaves like a Pauli paramagnet.</p><p>In conclusion, neither <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}\)</span> nor <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{\text {int }}\)</span> favors any kind of magnetic order. However, their sum <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{0}+\hat{H}_{\text {int }}\)</span> sometimes does. In Section 2.5 we illustrate an example of this phenomenon.</p><h3 id="particle-hole-symmetry">Particle-hole symmetry</h3><p>In this section we solve explicitly the Hubbard model with only two sites, the so called Hubbard dimer, with Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}=T \sum_{\sigma}\left(\hat{d}_{1 \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{2 \sigma}+\hat{d}_{2 \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{1 \sigma}\right)+U\left(\hat{n}_{1 \uparrow} \hat{n}_{1 \downarrow}+\hat{n}_{2 \uparrow} \hat{n}_{2 \downarrow}\right)\]</span> This Hamiltonian belongs to a general class of Hubbard Hamiltonians defined on bipartite lattices, i.e., lattices that can be divided into two sets of sites <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> with hoppings only from sites of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to sites of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and vice versa, i.e. <span class="math display">\[\hat{H}_{ bip }=\sum_{\sigma} \sum_{s \in A \atop s^{\prime} \in B}\left(h_{s s^{\prime}} \hat{d}_{s \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{s^{\prime} \sigma}+h_{s^{\prime} s} \hat{d}_{s^{\prime} \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{s \sigma}\right)+\sum_{s} U_{s} \hat{n}_{s \uparrow} \hat{n}_{s \downarrow}\]</span> In the Hubbard dimer <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is site 1 and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is site 2 and <span class="math inline">\(h_{12}=T .\)</span> If the lattice is bipartite and if <span class="math inline">\(h_{s s^{\prime}}=h_{s^{\prime} s}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_{s}=U\)</span> is independent of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, the Hubbard Hamiltonian enjoys an interesting particle-hole symmetry which can be used to simplify the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenkets. Let us first explain what this symmetry is. The fermionic operators <span class="math display">\[\hat{b}_{ s \sigma} \equiv\left\{\begin{aligned}\hat{d}_{s \sigma}^{\dagger} &amp; s \in A \\-\hat{d}_{s \sigma}^{\dagger} &amp; s \in B\end{aligned}\right.\]</span> satisfy the same anti-commutation relations as the original <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> operators, and in terms of them <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{\text {bip }}\)</span> becomes <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\hat{H}_{\text {bip }} &amp;=-\sum_{\sigma} \sum_{s \in A \atop s^{\prime} \in B}\left(h_{s s^{\prime}}, \hat{b}_{s \sigma} \hat{b}_{s^{\prime} \sigma}^{\dagger}+h_{s^{\prime} s} \hat{b}_{s^{\prime} \sigma} \hat{b}_{s \sigma}^{\dagger}\right)+U \sum_{s} \hat{b}_{s \uparrow} \hat{b}_{s \uparrow}^{\dagger} \hat{b}_{s \downarrow} \hat{b}_{s \downarrow}^{\dagger} \\&amp;=\sum_{\sigma} \sum_{s \in A \atop s^{\prime} \in B}\left(h_{s s^{\prime}} \hat{b}_{s \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{b}_{s^{\prime} \sigma}+h_{s^{\prime} s} \hat{b}_{s^{\prime} \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{b}_{s \sigma}\right)+U \sum_{s} \hat{n}_{s \uparrow}^{(b)} \hat{n}_{s \downarrow}^{(b)}-U \hat{N}^{(b)}+U N_{V}\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{n}_{s \sigma}^{(b)}=\hat{b}_{s \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{b}_{s \sigma}, \hat{N}^{(b)}=\sum_{s \sigma} \hat{n}_{s \sigma}^{(b)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_{ V }\)</span> is the total number of sites. Except for the last two terms, which both commute with the first two terms, the Hamiltonian written with the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{b}\)</span> -operators is identical to the Hamiltonian written with the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> -operators. This means that if <span class="math display">\[|\Psi\rangle=\sum_{s_{1} \ldots s_{N_{\uparrow}}} \sum_{s_{1}^{\prime} \ldots s_{N_{\downarrow}}^{\prime}} \Psi\left(s_{1} \uparrow, \ldots, s_{N_{\uparrow}} \uparrow, s_{1}^{\prime} \downarrow, \ldots, s_{N_{\downarrow}}^{\prime} \downarrow\right) \hat{d}_{s_{1} \uparrow}^{\dagger} \ldots \hat{d}_{s_{N_{\uparrow}} \uparrow}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{s_{1}^{\prime} \downarrow}^{\dagger} \ldots \hat{d}_{s_{N_{\downarrow}}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\]</span> is an eigenstate of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{\text {bip }}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(N_{\sigma}\)</span> electrons of spin <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and energy <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, then the state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Psi^{(b)}\right\rangle\)</span> obtained from <span class="math inline">\(|\Psi\rangle\)</span> by replacing the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> -operators with the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{b}\)</span> -operators and the empty ket |0with the empty ket <span class="math inline">\(\left|0^{(b)}\right\rangle\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{b}\)</span> -operators is also an eigenstate of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{ bip }\)</span> but with energy <span class="math inline">\(E-U\left(N_{\uparrow}+N_{\downarrow}\right)+U N_{ V }\)</span>. The empty ket <span class="math inline">\(\left|0^{(b)}\right\rangle\)</span> is by definition the ket for which <span class="math inline">\(\hat{b}_{s \sigma}\left|0^{(b)}\right\rangle=0 \quad\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span></p><p>Recalling the definition of the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{b}\)</span> -operators, this is equivalent to saying that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{s \sigma}^{\dagger}\left|0^{(b)}\right\rangle=0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, i.e., the ket <span class="math inline">\(\left|0^{(b)}\right\rangle\)</span> is the full ket with one electron of spin up and down on every site. Thus the state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Psi^{(b)}\right\rangle\)</span> can alternatively be written as a linear combination of products of annihilation <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}\)</span> -operators acting on the full ket. The number of electrons of spin <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\left|\Psi^{(b)}\right\rangle\)</span> is therefore <span class="math inline">\(N_{ V }-N_{\sigma} .\)</span> In conclusion we can say that if <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is an eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{ bip }\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(N_{\sigma}\)</span> electrons of spin <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(E-U\left(N_{\uparrow}+N_{\downarrow}\right)+U N_{ V }\)</span> is also an eigenvalue of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}_{\text {bip }}\)</span> but with <span class="math inline">\(N_{ V }-N_{\sigma}\)</span> electrons of spin <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. The relation between the corresponding eigenkets is that the empty ket is replaced by the full ket and the creation operators are replaced by the annihilation operators. Let us now return to the Hubbard dimer. The Fock space <span class="math display">\[F = H _{0} \oplus H _{1} \oplus H _{2} \oplus H _{3} \oplus H _{4}\]</span> is in this case finite because we cannot have more than four electrons. The zero-particle Hilbert space <span class="math inline">\(H _{0}\)</span> contains only the empty ket which is an eigenket of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> with eigenvalue 0 . In <span class="math inline">\(H _{1}\)</span> we have four possible kets <span class="math inline">\(|i \sigma\rangle=\hat{d}_{i \sigma}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2\)</span>. They are all eigenkets of the interaction operator with eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(0 .\)</span> Furthermore the matrix <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle i \sigma|\hat{H}| j \sigma^{\prime}\right\rangle=\delta_{\sigma \sigma^{\prime}} h_{i j}\)</span> is spin diagonal. The eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(h=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0 &amp; T \\ T &amp; 0\end{array}\right)\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(\pm T\)</span> and the corresponding eigenvectors are <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1,\pm 1)\)</span>. Thus, the one-particle eigenkets of the Hubbard dimer are <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\hat{d}_{1 \sigma}^{\dagger} \pm \hat{d}_{2 \sigma}^{\dagger}\right)|0\rangle\)</span> see also Table <span class="math inline">\(2.1 .\)</span> Let us now consider the two-particle Hilbert space <span class="math inline">\(H _{2} .\)</span> If both electrons have spin <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> then the only possible ket is <span class="math inline">\(\hat{d}_{1 \sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{2 \sigma}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\)</span> due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The reader can easily verify that this ket is an eigenket of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> with eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(0 .\)</span> In particular it is also an eigenket of the interaction Hamiltonian with eigenvalue 0 since the electrons have parallel spin. On the other hand, if the electrons have opposite spin then we have four possible kets: <span class="math display">\[\left|\Psi_{1}\right\rangle=\hat{d}_{1 \uparrow}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{1 \downarrow}^{\dagger}|0\rangle, \quad\left|\Psi_{2}\right\rangle=\hat{d}_{2 \uparrow}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{2 \downarrow}^{\dagger}|0\rangle, \quad\left|\Psi_{3}\right\rangle=\hat{d}_{1 \uparrow}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{2 \downarrow}^{\dagger}|0\rangle, \quad\left|\Psi_{4}\right\rangle=\hat{d}_{1 \downarrow}^{\dagger} \hat{d}_{2 \uparrow}^{\dagger}|0\rangle\]</span></p><p>$$ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}  &amp;  &amp;  \ H <em>{0} &amp; 0 &amp; |0\ H </em>{1} &amp; T &amp; (<em>{1 }^{} </em>{2 }^{})|0\ </p><p>H <em>{3} &amp; T+U &amp; (</em>{1 }^{} <em>{2 }^{} </em>{2 }^{} <em>{1 }^{} </em>{1 }^{} <em>{2 }^{})|0\ H </em>{4} &amp; 2 U &amp; <em>{1 }^{} </em>{1 }^{} <em>{2 }^{} </em>{2 }^{}|0\  H <em>{2} &amp; 0 &amp;</em>{1 }^{} <em>{2 }^{}|0\ &amp; 0 &amp;</em>{1 }^{} <em>{2 }^{}|0\ &amp; 0 &amp; |0\ &amp; U &amp; |0\ &amp; E</em>{3}=(U-) &amp; |0\ &amp; E_{4}=(U+) &amp; |0\  \end{array} $$</p><blockquote><p>Table 2.1 Eigenvalues and normalized eigenkets of the Hubbard dimer in the different Hilbert spaces. In the table the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=\sqrt{16 T^{2}+U^{2}}\)</span>.</p></blockquote><p>The Hamiltonian does not couple these states to those with parallel spin. Therefore, we can calculate the remaining eigenvalues and eigenkets in <span class="math inline">\(H _{2}\)</span> by diagonalizing the matrix <span class="math inline">\(h_{2}\)</span> with elements <span class="math inline">\(\left(h_{2}\right)_{i j}=\left\langle\Psi_{i}|\hat{H}| \Psi_{j}\right\rangle .\)</span> After some simple algebra one finds <span class="math display">\[h_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}U &amp; 0 &amp; T &amp; -T \\0 &amp; U &amp; T &amp; -T \\T &amp; T &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\-T &amp; -T &amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{array}\right)\]</span> This matrix has eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(E_{1}=0, E_{2}=U, E_{3}=\frac{1}{2}(U-\Delta),\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_{4}=\frac{1}{2}(U+\Delta)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=\sqrt{16 T^{2}+U^{2}}\)</span>. Let us take, e.g., <span class="math inline">\(U&gt;0\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(E_{3}&lt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_{4}&gt;0 .\)</span> The normalized eigenkets corresponding to these eigenvalues are reported in Table <span class="math inline">\(2.1 .\)</span> The occurrence of the zero eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(E_{1}\)</span> should not come as a surprise. The Hamiltonian commutes with the total spin operator <span class="math inline">\(\hat{S}^{2}=\left(\hat{ S }_{1}+\hat{ S }_{2}\right) \cdot\left(\hat{ S }_{1}+\hat{ S }_{2}\right),\)</span> as well as with <span class="math inline">\(\hat{S}^{z}=\hat{S}_{1}^{z}+\hat{S}_{2}^{z}\)</span> (the spin operators were defined in (1.92)<span class="math inline">\()\)</span>. Therefore the degenerate eigenkets of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}\)</span> must belong to spin multiplets. It is easy to see that the three eigenkets with vanishing eigenvalue belong to a triplet whereas the eigenkets with eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(E_{2}, E_{3}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_{4}\)</span> are singlets. To conclude our analysis we must calculate the eigenkets and eigenvalues with three and four particles. This can be done using the particle-hole symmetry and the results are reported in Table <span class="math inline">\(2.1 .\)</span> It is interesting to observe that when <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow 0\)</span> the eigenvalues in <span class="math inline">\(H _{2}\)</span> become 0 (4 times degenerate) and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> (two times degenerate). This is the dissociation limit which corresponds to pulling the two atomic sites infinitely far apart. The results agree with our physical intuition; if two isolated (Hubbard) atoms have one electron each (either with spin up or down) then the energy is zero whereas if both electrons are on the same atom then the energy is <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>.</p><h2 id="heisenberg-model">Heisenberg model</h2>]]></content>

中的方法</p><p>We first define a U(1) link variable from the wave functions of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th band as <span class="math display">\[U_{\mu}\left(k_{\ell}\right) \equiv\left\langle n\left(k_{\ell}\right) \mid n\left(k_{\ell}+\hat{\mu}\right)\right\rangle / N _{\mu}\left(k_{\ell}\right)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(N _{\mu}\left(k_{\ell}\right) \equiv\left|\left\langle n\left(k_{\ell}\right) \mid n\left(k_{\ell}+\hat{\mu}\right)\right\rangle\right| .\)</span> The link variables are well defined as long as <span class="math inline">\(N _{\mu}\left(k_{\ell}\right) \neq 0,\)</span> which can always be assumed to be the case (one can avoid a singularity <span class="math inline">\(N _{\mu}\left(k_{\ell}\right)=0\)</span> by an infinitesimal shift of the lattice). From the link variable (7), we next define a lattice field strength by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\tilde{F}_{12}\left(k_{\ell}\right) &amp; \equiv \ln U_{1}\left(k_{\ell}\right) U_{2}\left(k_{\ell}+\hat{1}\right) U_{1}\left(k_{\ell}+\hat{2}\right)^{-1} U_{2}\left(k_{\ell}\right)^{-1} \\-\pi &amp;&lt;\frac{1}{ i } \tilde{F}_{12}\left(k_{\ell}\right) \leq \pi\end{aligned}\]</span> Note that the field strength is defined within the principal branch of the logarithm specified in eq. (8). It is obvious that this field strength is invariant under the gauge transformation (3). Finally, we define the Chern number on the lattice which is associated to the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th band as <span class="math display">\[\tilde{c}_{n} \equiv \frac{1}{2 \pi i } \sum_{\ell} \tilde{F}_{12}\left(k_{\ell}\right)\]</span> 这里以<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">文献</a> 中的“量子反常霍尔模型”的哈密顿量为例子，Python代码如下：</p><pre><code

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[TOC]</p><blockquote><p>"For me, mathematics is a collection of examples; a theorem is a statement about a collection of examples and the purpose of proving theorems is to classify and explain the examples."</p><p>—— John B. Conway</p></blockquote><h2 id="外尔半金属最小模型">外尔半金属最小模型</h2><p><span class="label label-primary"><strong>外尔点</strong>：能带在动量空间某处相交，而交点的能量又恰好在<strong>费米能级附近</strong></span></p><p>外尔半金属最小模型的哈密顿量 ： <span

\sqrt{M_{k}^{2}+A^{2}\left(k_{x}^{2}+k_{y}^{2}\right)}\]</span> 根据<strong>外尔点</strong>的定义：两个能带相交的点 <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}- \sqrt{M_{k}^{2}+A^{2}\left(k_{x}^{2}+k_{y}^{2}\right)}&amp;= \sqrt{M_{k}^{2}+A^{2}\left(k_{x}^{2}+k_{y}^{2}\right)}\end{aligned}\]</span> 所以</p><ul><li>$A<sup>{2}(k_{x}</sup>{2}+k_{y}^{2})=0 k_{x}=k_{y}=0 $</li><li>$M_{k}=0 M_{0}-M_{1} k_{z}^{2}=0 $</li></ul><p>把符合要求的动量定义为 <span class="math inline">\(k_z=k_{c} \equiv \sqrt{M_{0} / M_{1}}\)</span>，于是我们得到两个外尔点的坐标为 <span class="math display">\[\left(k_{x} +k_{y} +k_{z} \right)=\left(0,0, \pm k_{c}\right)\]</span></p><h4 id="数值">数值</h4><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-11.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><p>根据数值结果可以看出，在费米能级附近能带有两个交点。(代码见附录)</p><h2 id="表面态费米线">表面态：费米线</h2><p>y=0表面态的哈密顿量： <span class="math display">\[E_{\operatorname{arc}}\left(k_{x},

连接两个外尔点。</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-9.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><p>数值计算结果</p><h2 id="费米弧">费米弧</h2><p>外尔半金属最小模型的另一个模型 <span class="math display">\[H=A\left(k_{x} \sigma_{x}+k_{y} \sigma_{y}\right)+M\left(k_{w}^{2}-k^{2}\right) \sigma_{z}\]</span> 该形式与上面那种形式 <span class="math inline">\(H=A\left(k_{x} \sigma_{x}+k_{y} \sigma_{y}\right)+M_{k} \sigma_{z}\)</span> 是等价的。对应关系为：</p><ul><li><span class="math inline">\(M_{0} \rightarrow M k_{w}^{2}\)</span></li><li><span class="math inline">\(M_{1} \rightarrow

\sqrt{M^{2}-D_{1}^{2}}\)</span></li></ul><p>从表面态哈密顿量可以看出，这时候给定一个费米能，表面态不再是一个线段，而是在限制条件下的一段曲线，称为费米弧。</p><h2 id="陈数的计算">陈数的计算</h2><p>外尔半金属的拓扑数计算</p><p>现在我们计算 <span class="math inline">\(H( k )= k \cdot

LONZARICH University of Cambridge</p><p>[TOC]</p><h2 id="introduction">6.1 Introduction</h2><p>The aim of this chapter is to provide an introduction to the role of spin in systems of interacting electrons in conducting materials. To make this discussion manageable, we limit ourselves mainly to states with no long-range magnetic order and in vanishing external magnetic fields. Even under these simplifying conditions, the electron spin, in conjunction with the electronelectron interaction, can lead to subtle and remarkable co-operative phenomena. These include new kinds of 'normal' states and forms of superconductivity in which binding of Cooper pairs arises not from phonons, as in simple metals, but via the effects of spin fluctuations in the electron system itself.</p><h4 id="boundary-between-magnetic-and-non-magnetic-order">6.1.1 Boundary between magnetic and non-magnetic order</h4><p>The above phenomena may be found in conductors in which the Coulomb interaction leads to strong local, but not static, spin alignment. In this spin 'liquid' state, the electrons themselves may move rapidly, but the spin density they produce will appear to be undergoing slow and large-amplitude spontaneous fluctuations.</p><p>In a magnetic state of a conventional kind, e.g. in the case of ferromagnetism or anti-ferromagnetism, fluctuations of a particular wave vector have a static component of finite amplitude. We may imagine arriving at our spin liquid state by 'melting' this frozen-in magnetic order in some appropriate manner. This crossover from the frozen to the liquid state is quite different from that of normal phase transitions. In the latter, an ordered state melts with increasing temperature into a disordered state of higher entropy. But the melting process we are considering is at a fixed temperature as a function of some other control parameter, such as the strength of the screened electron-electron interaction. In practice, this may be achieved by varying the lattice spacing (via hydrostatic pressure) or the composition of the underlying atomic structure.</p><p>In the zero-temperature limit, such transitions involve no change in entropy. Hence, they cannot be viewed as transformations from order to disorder, but rather from conventional order to some more subtle 'hidden' order. In the latter, the conventional order parameter undergoes spontaneous quantum fluctuations with zero mean.</p><p>An example of this kind of quantum melting is the transition of solid helium- <span class="math inline">\(4\left({ }^{4} He \right)\)</span> to a liquid as a function of pressure at a low temperature below the <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> point. In the low-temperature limit, the latter is not less ordered than the former, i.e. both have zero entropy and are in well defined quantum states. But the nature of the underlying order in the quantum liquid state is subtle and more difficult to visualise than that of the solid.</p><p>Our spin problem is partly, but not wholly, analogous to that of <span class="math inline">\({ }^{4} He .\)</span> The solid would correspond to conventional magnetic alignment and the quantum liquid to a state characterised in part by quantum fluctuations in the spin density. But the spin is only one of the variables which can play a role in determining the nature of the new ordered state. since the electrons are itinerant, we must consider not only the spin, but also the charge and transverse current densities. The latter are clearly important in determining thermal and electrical conductivities as well as instabilities to superconducting phases. since all of these variables are in general coupled to each other, the number of possible ordered states may be considerable, and the results could depend sensitively on fine details of the electron orbitals and of the underlying lattice. In section 6.1 .2 we introduce a model which provides us with a tractable way of thinking about electron systems near the boundary separating magnetic and quantum spin liquid phases. The model has helped to shed light on a wide range of unusual phenomena observed in nearly magnetic d-metals. It also provides a qualitative background for the study of the heavy fermion compounds and of the copper oxide conductors. Systems such as these, which find themselves near the boundary between magnetic and non-magnetic order, are remarkably widespread. A reason for their pervasiveness arises quite naturally out of the model we shall develop.</p><h4 id="fermions-and-interaction-fields">6.1.2 Fermions and interaction fields</h4><p>It is conventional to begin a treatment of the properties of conducting materials with a model of electrons interacting with each other and an underlying lattice of ions via a static Coulomb interaction. For reasons which will become clear below, it is useful to begin at the still more fundamental level of quantum electrodynamics, namely the theory of matter and light (Feynman <span class="math inline">\(1985 ;\)</span> Feynman and Hibbs 1965 ). In this framework, the ground state is imagined to be a vacuum and the elementary excitations above this vacuum are Fermi and Bose particles, i.e. electrons and photons.</p><p>The bosons are the well known quanta of Maxwell's electromagnetic interaction field. The fermions, though usually treated as particles from the start, may also be imagined to be quanta of some fundamental field. The latter satisfies the Dirac equation (chapter 3 ) and its quantisation proceeds in a way analogous to that of Maxwell's field, but the operator used to replace the classical field is constructed in such a way as to guarantee that the resulting quanta will obey the Pauli principle.</p><p>This leads to a picture of two fields forming initially separate linear subsystems which are then coupled. The quanta of the matter field do not interact with each other directly, but only with the quanta of the interaction field. If the bosons are in a formal sense 'filtered out', we would then 'observe' fermions that appear to interact with each other via a retarded potential. The latter is the indirect effect of the exchange between fermions of the now 'hidden' bosons. This procedure, known as integrating out the boson field, can be made mathematically precise. <span class="math inline">\(^{\dagger}\)</span> For our purposes, however, it will be sufficient to rely on an analogy to conventional filtering.</p><h2 id="low-frequency-and-long-wavelength-phenomena">6.2 Low-frequency and long-wavelength phenomena</h2><p>With this brief outline of key ideas from quantum electrodynamics, we now return to our original problem. For simplicity, we confine our attention to phenomena involving spontaneous fluctuations of low frequency <span class="math inline">\(\left(\omega&lt;\omega_{ c }\right)\)</span> and small wave vectors <span class="math inline">\(\left(q&lt;q_{ c }\right) .\)</span> For now, we assume only that the cut-off wave vector <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> and frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{ c }\)</span> are small compared with the Brillouin zone dimension and the Fermi energy, respectively. It will turn out that some properties predicted by the model presented below depend mainly on the behaviour of the system in the limit of low <span class="math inline">\(q, \omega\)</span> and hence are relatively insensitive to the precise choice of <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{ c }\)</span></p><p>To focus attention on processes within <span class="math inline">\(q&lt;q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega&lt;\omega_{ c },\)</span> we may imagine formally filtering out all Fourier components of fluctuating variables outside of this window. In technical terms, this means integrating out the phonon and photon field components with <span class="math inline">\(q&gt;q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega&gt;\omega_{ c },\)</span> and the electron field components with wave vectors outside of a window of width of the order of <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> about the Fermi surface (Shankar 1994 ).</p><p>This procedure might be expected to lead to a picture somewhat analogous to that of the previous section. But the fermions in the new model will be defined only on a shell near the Fermi surface and will have a modified energy spectrum. The bosons in the filtered description can also be radically different from the original phonons and photons. As in quantum electrodynamics, the fermions emit and absorb these bosons and hence experience a new kind of retarded interaction, which may be viewed as a screened version of the original potential.</p><p>Within this picture, the key problem is to identify the dominant part of the boson field, or the induced interaction it produces, and attempt to model its main properties in a tractable fashion. At this stage, it might be supposed that a reasonable starting point for this effective interaction is simply the conventional Thomas-Fermi potential or its generalisation in terms of standard dielectric theory. But for a system close to a magnetic phase transition, a still more important interaction field emerges out of the complex filtering process which we have carried out.</p><h4 id="the-exchange-field">6.2.1 The exchange field</h4><p>To understand the nature of this new dynamical interaction field, we return to the original concept of an exchange molecular field introduced in phenomenological descriptions of magnetism (White 1983 ). In this treatment, the effects of the electron-electron interaction acting through constraints imposed by the Pauli principle may be described in terms of an effective magnetic field which couples to the electron spin (and not to the current) and which varies in proportion to the uniform magnetisation. This implies that in an applied magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(H,\)</span> the magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> will satisfy <span class="math inline">\(M=\chi_{0}(H+\lambda M),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda M\)</span> is the exchange field, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a coupling constant, and <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{0}\)</span> is the magnetic susceptibility when <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> Solving for <span class="math inline">\(M,\)</span> we obtain a final susceptibility of the well known form <span class="math inline">\(\chi=\chi_{0} /\left(1-\lambda \chi_{0}\right),\)</span> which is enhanced over <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{0}\)</span> in the normal case where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is positive. For <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \chi_{0} \geqslant 1,\)</span> the feedback produced by the exchange field is critical or over-critical, and magnetic polarisation can occur spontaneously in the absence of the applied field. As in the analogous problem of a self-oscillating feedback amplifier, the amplitude of the spontaneous polarisation in the over-critical state is governed by anharmonicities. In the model developed in section <span class="math inline">\(6.3,\)</span> the non-linear dependence of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> may be described in the form <span class="math inline">\(H=a M+b M^{3}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> given above and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the anharmonicity parameter (Edwards and Wohlfarth 1968 ). In the over-critical regime, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is negative and the magnetisation in zero external field grows spontaneously to a magnitude <span class="math inline">\((-a / b)^{1 / 2}\)</span> limited by the coefficient of the non-linear term in <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></p><p>This conventional description is normally applied to the uniform average magnetisation alone. It is now proposed to extend the concept of an exchange field to deal with space- and time-varying processes with <span class="math inline">\(q, \omega\)</span> components in our specified window. This interaction field is then dynamical and forms a subsystem in analogy to the electromagnetic field in the original problem.</p><p>In this way, we arrive at a low-frequency and long-wavelength model consisting of fermions in a narrow range close to the Fermi surface plus the exchange field. As in the starting theory of section <span class="math inline">\(6.1,\)</span> the fermions do not interact directly with each other, but only with the exchange field itself. And if we filter out the latter, we are led to a picture of fermions which appear to be coupled via a retarded and spin-dependent interaction that originates from the now 'invisible' exchange field.</p><p>It is helpful to view this unfamiliar interaction field as analogous to the more primitive counterpart in quantum electrodynamics. It fluctuates spontaneously, and on average will 'follow' the time- and space-varying magnetisation set up by the spins of the fermions qualitatively in the way that the electromagnetic field, through Maxwell's equations, may respond on average to the charge and current densities of the electrons.</p><p>The model of fermions and an interaction field related to the magnetisation incorporates the twin features raised in section <span class="math inline">\(6.1 .\)</span> Namely, it describes both the itineracy of the electrons and the importance of slow magnetisation fluctuations in the spin liquid state. The fermions in the model describe the former, while the interaction field will allow us to incorporate the latter feature.</p><h4 id="fermi-liquid-model">6.2.2 Fermi liquid model</h4><p>The basic scattering processes which may occur in this low-frequency and long-wavelength world can be summarised as follows. First, the fermions may undergo single transitions (within their restricted shell near the Fermi level) via the emission or absorption of the exchange field. The strong constraint imposed by the Pauli principle on these transitions at low temperatures normally allows us to extract useful results in leading order in perturbation theory, i.e. in the Born approximation which yields the fermion scattering rate or lifetime.</p><p>Secondly, fermions may first emit and then recapture the same exchange ficld. This process may be interpreted as a self-interaction, which leads, as in the corresponding classical theory of the electron, to a renormalisation of the effective mass, or more generally of the apparent energy spectrum, of the fermions. This spectrum for a chosen state near the Fermi level may be determined via a final filtering process in which the interaction field and all states, except the one in question, are formally integrated out. The fermions characterised by this fully renormalised spectrum will be called quasiparticles.</p><p>We note that the self-interaction leads us not only to the quasi-particle mass but also to the lifetime which we discussed above in terms of single emission and absorption processes. The mass and lifetime of a quasi-particle, or more generally the real and imaginary parts of the quasi-particle energy spectrum, normally determine the heat capacity and (under suitable conditions) the resistivity of the interacting electrons.</p><p>In a paramagnetic state well away from a magnetic instability, the above model yields linear and quadratic temperature dependencies, respectively, for the heat capacity <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and the resistivity <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> at a low temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. We note that <span class="math inline">\(C / T\)</span> is proportional to the average of the quasi-particle mass on the Fermi surface at low temperatures. In a similar way, it is useful to view <span class="math inline">\(\rho / T^{2}\)</span> as a measure of an effective scattering cross-section. This cross-section is that for a quasi-particle colliding with another quasi-particle via the full induced inter- action which we have described, and before account is taken of the <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> factor arising from the constraint imposed by the Pauli principle on allowed scattering processes.</p><p>This behaviour of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is that expected for the Standard Model, known as the Landau Fermi liquid theory, which may be viewed as an extension and generalisation of the traditional single-particle description of conduction electron systems (Baym and Pethick 1991 ). The Fermi liquid model, in both its early and final modern forms, has played a central role in the physics of condensed matter since the development of quantum mechanics (chapter 5 ).</p><h4 id="breakdown-of-the-fermi-liquid-description">6.2.3 Breakdown of the Fermi liquid description</h4><p>As the magnetic instability is approached, and spontaneous magnetic fluctuations slow down and grow in amplitude, the normal Fermi liquid description for the temperature dependence of thermal and transport properties may break down.</p><p>For simplicity, we consider a homogeneous isotropic model of an electron system near a ferromagnetic instability in three spatial dimensions. It will be argued in section 6.4 that the temperature dependence of the heat capacity and resistivity should in this case have the anomalous forms <span class="math inline">\(C \propto T \ln \left(T^{*} / T\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho \propto T^{5 / 3},\)</span> in place of the usual linear and quadratic variations, respectively, of the normal Fermi liquid model. This anomalous behaviour, which is found to be consistent with recent high-pressure studies of certain cubic d-metal ferromagnets, is associated with a state known as the marginal Fermi liquid (Baym and Pethick 1991 ).</p><p>If we interpret, as in section <span class="math inline">\(6.2 .2, C / T \propto \ln \left(T^{*} / T\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho / T^{2} \propto T^{-1 / 3}\)</span> as the quasi-particle mass and cross-section, respectively, we are led to the conclusion that, in the above state, the quasi-particle properties are singular and hence ill defined in the <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow 0\)</span> limit.</p><p>This apparent divergence of the quasi-particle 'size', as defined via the mass and cross-section, may be attributed to the fact that the range of the induced interaction tends to grow without limit at the critical point, i.e. where the magnetic transition temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c } \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> This induced interaction arises essentially as follows. A fermion introduced into the system on the verge of a magnetic instability will nucleate local spin order which radiates outward. The magnetisation induced by this first fermion then produces an exchange field that can act on the spin of a second fermion some distance away. The range of this indirect coupling should grow as the tendency for long-range order increases, i.e. the range should vary as the magnetic correlation length which diverges at a continuous phase transition. It is plausible that the cross-section for quasi-particle-quasi-particle scattering and the quasi-particle mass would then also exhibit anomalous behaviour. <span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span></p><p>Let us recall that this spin-spin interaction originates from the spinindependent Coulomb potential itself in conjunction with the spin-dependent effects of the Pauli principle. The true magnetic interaction arising from Maxwell's fields, i.e. the current-current and dipole-dipole couplings, can also remain long range at the end of the screening process. But these are very weak compared with the Coulomb potential and (at least in three dimensions) are expected to lead to a breakdown of the Fermi liquid description only at extremely low temperatures and in metals of extraordinarily high conductivity. We may then summarise our results as follows. In the paramagnetic state, well away from the critical point, the range of the residual spin-spin interaction is short, and the normal Fermi liquid model describes the low-temperature properties with essentially constant quasi-particle mass and cross-section.</p><p>As the critical point is approached and the interaction grows in intensity and range, the mass and cross-section increase in magnitude and, though still finite as <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow 0,\)</span> become strongly temperature dependent. This is the heavy fermion behaviour found frequently among nearly ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic f-electron compounds as well as certain d-metals and low-dimensional conductors (see Coleman <span class="math inline">\(1995 a , b\)</span> and chapter 5 in this volume). Finally, at the critical point of a continuous phase transition, the effective interaction and, hence, the quasi-particle properties become strongly temperature dependent and singular as <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> In this limit, the concept of a fermion quasi-particle becomes ill defined. A singular mass would imply, for example, that a quasiparticle state of a given wave vector has a vanishing probability of being connected with a normal fermion state of the same wave vector. Hence, the conventional association of quasi-particles with single electrons breaks down. Finally, we comment that the range of applicability of non-Fermi liquid models as developed in section 6.3 is not restricted to the critical point alone. Anomalous temperature dependences of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> are both expected and observed over wide ranges in both temperature and the control parameter (e.g. pressure) used to cross the boundary between magnetic and non-magnetic states.</p><h4 id="anisotropic-superconductivity">6.2.4 Anisotropic superconductivity</h4><p>In section 6.2 .3 we considered the breakdown of the Fermi liquid description due to the long-range nature of the induced interaction. But this is not the only way in which the effective interaction can destabilise the normal state. In particular, a second condition for the stability of the conventional Fermi liquid, namely the requirement that the effective interaction must be repulsive, can also be violated for our indirect spin-spin coupling. In an isotropic model, this coupling is proportional to the inner product of the spins of interacting fermion pairs and hence can be attractive or repulsive depending on the relative spin orientation.</p><p>In nearly ferromagnetic systems, the effective spin coupling tends to be attractive for fermions of the same spin. This favours the formation of Cooper pairs of parallel spins and, under suitable conditions at sufficiently low temperatures, can lead to an unusual kind of superconductivity.</p><p>It differs from conventional superconductivity in that the pairing interaction is due to the exchange field itself rather than phonons and, since the spins are in a triplet state, the Cooper pairs form in p-wave rather than s-wave orbital states. The internal spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the former lead to superconducting order parameters with multiple components (chapter 7 ) and anisotropies not found in the conventional singlet s-wave counterparts (Leggett <span class="math inline">\(1975 ;\)</span> Sigrist and Ueda 1991 ).</p><p>Due to their anisotropic nature, p-wave, d-wave and higher-order superconducting states can be destabilised by scattering processes which are normally harmless to the isotropic s-wave systems. In particular, the anisotropic states are expected to be observed only when the carrier mean free path <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> exceeds the superconducting coherence length <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> (i.e. the characteristic spatial extent of the Cooper pair orbitals).</p><p>Anisotropic superconductivity is therefore most stable in systems in which <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is small. since the latter varies as the Fermi velocity and inversely as the superconducting energy gap, the heavy fermion systems (Steglich et al. 1979 ; Ott et al. <span class="math inline">\(1983 ;\)</span> Stewart <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. 1984 and others and the high-temperature (e.g. copper oxide) superconductors (Bednorz and Müller <span class="math inline">\(1986 ;\)</span> Wu et al. 1987 and others) are naturally favoured. Evidence for the existence of anisotropic superconductivity in some of these systems is now considerable. In most cases, however, the anisotropic states appear to be spin singlets with essentially dwave character. The latter would arise in the presence of interaction fields which have dominant components at high rather than low <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> e.g. as in incipient anti-ferromagnets rather than ferromagnets.</p><p>The simplest p-wave superconductivity consistent with the present model would be expected to exist in nearly ferromagnetic d-metals with weak spinorbit interaction. In the known candidates in this class, however, <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is expected to be one or two orders of magnitude greater than in the heavy fermions or high-temperature superconductors, respectively. This imposes conditions on carrier mean free paths beyond that achieved thus far, with the exception of the binary compound <span class="math inline">\(MnSi ^{*}\)</span> and the elemental metals. Among the latter, perhaps the most promising are the ferromagnets Co and <span class="math inline">\(Ni\)</span> at pressures high enough to suppress long-range magnetic order. found in one of these systems provided the magnetic to non-magnetic transition is not too abrupt and the inhomogeneities in the applied pressure do not lead to a breakdown of the requirement <span class="math inline">\(l \gg \xi\)</span></p><p>The high-pressure non-magnetic state of Ni might be similar to that of the isostructural and isoelectronic relatives <span class="math inline">\(Pd\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Pt\)</span>. Estimates based on the present model suggest, however, that the latter systems are already too far removed from the ferromagnetic instability to be viable candidates for the kind of superconductivity we are considering.</p><p>The simplest form of p-wave superconductivity remains elusive. A closely related but more complex state may exist in some of the uranium-based heavy fermion compounds. Also, a neutral analogue has been identified in the superfluid phases of liquid <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He in the low-millikelvin temperature range. The normal and superfluid properties of this neutral Fermi liquid are consistent with the model introduced in sections 6.3 and 6.4 for nearly ferromagnetic itinerant electron systems.</p><h4 id="additional-interaction-fields">6.2.5 Additional interaction fields</h4><p>Our focus on the exchange field associated with long-wavelength spin fluctuations limits our discussion to systems near ferromagnetic instabilities. The model presented in the next section can, however, be extended to describe the simplest examples of incipient anti-ferromagnetism in conducting materials. Other fluctuating variables, such as the charge density (for both the electrons and the ions) and the transverse current density, will also have their own corresponding molecular fields. The present treatment is restricted to those phenomena in which the exchange field, as defined more fully in the next section, plays the leading role.</p><h2 id="phenomenological-model">6.3 Phenomenological model</h2><h4 id="outline">6.3 .1 Outline</h4><p>Let us summarise the strategy intended to lead us to a tractable model for the phenomena reviewed in section <span class="math inline">\(6.2 .\)</span> The fundamental starting point, quantum electrodynamics of a dense system of electrons and ions interacting with photons, is of unimaginable complexity. since we are concerned only with lowtemperature phenomena, it is natural to reduce the apparent complexity by filtering out all but the low-frequency fluctuations in the relevant fields. Furthermore, except where otherwise stated, we also filter out all but the relatively low-wave-vector fluctuations expected to play the central role in the nearly ferromagnetic systems.</p><p>We assume that the system which we observe through our filter can still be described in terms of a model analogous in some respects to the starting theory. Thus, in the window defined by the cut-off parameters <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{ c }\)</span> introduced in section <span class="math inline">\(6.2,\)</span> we have, once again, fermions and interaction fields which are analogous to the electrons and the electromagnetic field, respectively, of the starting theory.</p><p>The analogy is, however, imperfect in several ways. In particular, the new model is not explicitly relativistic and the fermions are now defined only in a narrow shell (with thickness of the order <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> ) near the Fermi level. The latter implies that we cannot explicitly describe in the new model processes which involve transitions outside of this shell.</p><p>Except when prohibited by strict conservation principles, the physical properties of these fermions will also be different in general from those of the bare electrons. Thus, the fermion mass will be renormalised by the effects of all fields which have been integrated out. The quasi-particle mass, as we have noted, arises from the final level of renormalisation, when all influences, including those arising within our window, are taken into account. At least near the critical point <span class="math inline">\(\left(T_{ c } \rightarrow 0\right),\)</span> it is the interaction field which we retain explicitly in our model that is expected to produce the dominant renormalisation of the quasi-particle properties. As shown below, the singularities in the latter in fact arise from the infrared components of the field (i.e. those in the low <span class="math inline">\(q, \omega\)</span> limit) and hence are weakly dependent on our somewhat arbitrary cut-offs <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{ c }\)</span>.</p><p>The central task, as we have said, is to identify the dominant part of the interaction field. Our key assumption is that this can be described as an exchange field <span class="math inline">\(h_{ m }\)</span> which couples to the magnetic moment <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> (but not the velocity) of a fermion via a potential energy of the form <span class="math inline">\(-\mu \cdot h_{ m } .\)</span> In the simplest case, <span class="math inline">\(h_{ m }\)</span> is proportional to the local magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(m(r, t),\)</span> so that we may write <span class="math inline">\(h_{ m }=\lambda m,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the exchange field parameter (a phenomenological constant).</p><p>In a more general treatment, <span class="math inline">\(h_{ m }\)</span> would be a functional of <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> involving in lowest order a convolution of an exchange field function <span class="math inline">\(\lambda(r, t)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m(r, t) .\)</span> In next order we would retain an appropriate term cubic in <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. For a statistical treatment, the full interaction field must also include, in addition to the component which depends explicitly on <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> a randomly fluctuating part with zero mean. Near the critical point, however, the fluctuations in the overall exchange field are expected to follow closely those of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> itself.</p><p>We stress that the Fourier components of both <span class="math inline">\(h_{ m }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are finite in our model only for <span class="math inline">\(q&lt;q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega&lt;\omega_{ c } .\)</span> We also restrict ourselves to cubic lattices and to the normal state (i.e. a state in the absence of symmetry breaking transitions). Under these conditions, the filtered system will appear essentially homogeneous and isotropic.</p><h5 id="alternative-descriptions">Alternative descriptions</h5><p>The model outlined above, of fermions and the exchange field coupled to each other, will be referred to as description</p><ul><li>(I). If we filter out (i.e. integrate out) the exchange field, we arrive at a description</li><li><ol start="2" type="I"><li>in which we have fermions alone coupled to each other via a retarded spin-spin interaction.

This leads us to a picture of a fluctuating anharmonic field alone (Moriya 1985). In this way, we arrive at a framework analogous to that normally used in the study of critical phenomena which focuses on the statistical properties of fluctuations in an order parameter field.

For a description of the resistivity and pair instabilities, we must then generally return to descriptions (I) or (II). But even for calculations of these properties, description (III) is fruitful in providing a self-consistent model for the (final) way in which the field fluctuates or propagates. This model may then be used directly to determine the resistivity via an approach analogous to that used for electron-phonon scattering (Ziman 1960 ), and the pair instability via a generalisation of the <span class="math inline">\(BCS\)</span> theory (Schrieffer 1964 ).</p><p>Our technical discussion will initially focus on description (III) and hence on the statistical mechanics of the field. It is important to stress that the field does not form a closed system. It is coupled strongly to the fermions which have been filtered from view. Thus, the modes of the field are necessarily heavily damped and, indeed, over-damped in the non-magnetic state we shall consider. To deal with this problem, the normal theory of statistical mechanics must therefore be generalised. The key ingredients which will lead to a simplification of our treatment of the temperature dependences of the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity will be the fluctuation dissipation (Nyquist's) theorem and the related concept of the entropy of a dissipative mode of a system.</p><p>From the coupling of the field to the fermion moment <span class="math inline">\(\left(-\mu \cdot h_{ m }\right),\)</span> we may then develop models for the resistivity and pair instability. The key results of</p><p>this second stage of the programme will be summarised but not derived in full detail here.</p><p>As in the quantum theory of electromagnetism, the starting point in our discussion is the space and time behaviour of the interaction field. Since in the limit we shall consider the relevant interaction field is essentially always proportional to the local magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(m(r, t),\)</span> it will be sufficient to focus on the dynamics of the latter more physical variable.</p><h4 id="field-equation">6.3.2 Field equation</h4><p>In principle, the dynamics of the interaction field may be obtained by the formal method of integrating out essentially all other variables in the problem. This is, of course, impractical for real systems without the use of auxiliary assumptions, the validity of which is difficult to assess.</p><p>An alternative approach is to postulate from the start, on the basis of empirical evidence and other constraints, the form of the field equation. From this intermediate starting point we may go 'forward' to determine the implications of the model for various observable properties, or else 'backward' towards a deeper understanding of the origin of the field equation and of its limitations in terms of a more microscopic model. The latter link between the microscopic and macroscopic levels clearly becomes more tenuous as we explore systems of increasing levels of complexity.</p><p>We will begin with an intermediate starting point and consider the implications for experimentally observable properties. Where possible, the known links to the more microscopic description will be indicated, but not developed explicitly. In this way, the phenomena discussed in sections 6.1 and 6.2 may be seen to arise in simple terms from a plausible common origin, namely the field equation for <span class="math inline">\(m ( r , t),\)</span> which will be developed below.</p><h5 id="static-scalar-field">Static scalar field</h5><p>For simplicity, we consider in this and the following sub-section, a scalar model of the field.

This is adequate for an isotropic system in the paramagnetic state in the linear regime, i.e. for small <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(H \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> But to investigate effects of the random field in the statistical treatment of the next section, we need to go beyond the harmonic model for the dynamics of a vector <span class="math inline">\(M .\)</span> This leads us to consider two types of non-linear terms. The first, already present in the scalar model, is the cubic term in eq. (1) which we now write in a slightly more general vector form <span class="math inline">\(M(M \cdot M)\)</span> in the vector extension <span class="math inline">\(H[M]\)</span> of eq. (1)</p><p>The second form of anharmonicity (present in the vector model alone) arises from the fact that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> will precess about some effective field <span class="math inline">\(H_{ eff }^{\prime},\)</span> a part of which depends on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> itself. <span class="math inline">\(\dot{ M }\)</span> will vanish as required in equilibrium if we take <span class="math inline">\(H_{ eff }^{\prime}=H_{ eff }\)</span> given by the vector extension of eq. (2). We are thus led to postulate a vector generalisation of eq. (3) <span class="math display">\[\dot{ M }=\zeta\left( M \times H _{ eff }\right)+\gamma * H _{ eff }\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(H_{ eff }=H-H[M]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\zeta\)</span> is an appropriate gyroscopic ratio. Since <span class="math inline">\(M \times M=0,\)</span> we may replace <span class="math inline">\(H_{ eff }\)</span> in the cross-product in eq. (6) by <span class="math inline">\(H+\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(c \nabla^{2} M,\)</span> an effective field which also appears in the Landau-Lifshitz model for a ferromagnet with a local magnetisation of fixed amplitude and in the absence of damping (Herring <span class="math inline">\(1966 ;\)</span> Lifshitz and Pitaevskii 1980 ).</p><p>For a paramagnet, it follows from the fact that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> vanishes as <span class="math inline">\(H \rightarrow 0\)</span> that the precession term in eq. (6) is strictly non-linear in <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Thus, to leading order each component of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is correctly described, as expected, by our original scalar model (3). Non-linear precession, however, will be important in the presence of some additional field (e.g. a uniform component on top of a modulation) and, as we have said, in the analysis of the effect of the random field (see section <span class="math inline">\(6.3 .4)\)</span></p><p>We arrive then at a dynamical non-local model which describes precession, decay and two types of anharmonicity. The parameters of the model <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c, \gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\zeta\)</span> are phenomenological constants. If the exchange field is strictly proportional to <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> then only <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> differs from that of the non-interacting fermions. The parameters apart from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> may then be read off by comparing the prediction of eq. (6) for the generalised susceptibility with the known Lindhard function, i.e. the generalised susceptibility for non-interacting fermions* (Moriya 1985). This comparison also provides us with a first-principle justification of eq. (6), which we have introduced on physical grounds.</p><p>The microscopic evaluation of the remaining parameter <span class="math inline">\(a\left(=a_{0}-\lambda\right)\)</span> is made difficult by the fact that, near the critical point, it is the difference of two almost equal numbers. Thus, in contrast to the other quantities, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is very sensitive to small corrections. Of particular interest are corrections due to thermal excitations, which we attempt to describe in terms of temperature-independent parameters and a universal thermal function. The dominant effect comes not from the Fermi function defining the parameters of the non-interacting fermions (e.g. the Pauli susceptibility), but rather the Bose function which describes the amplitude of spontaneous fluctuations in the local magnetisation. The way in which these fluctuations affect the thermal properties in general will be the subject of sections 6.3 .3 and 6.3 .4 .</p><h4 id="statistical-description-of-open-systems">6.3.3 Statistical description of open systems</h4><h5 id="quantisation">Quantisation</h5><p>The field equation (6) may be taken as a classical starting point for a quantum description. The quantisation of the field proceeds along one of two routes. The better known is the canonical, or operator, method, in which quantisation emerges from the discreteness of the eigensolutions. The second is the path integral technique, which involves an extension of stochastic theory to deal essentially with complex weights for configurations. In this approach, quantisation arises out of interference between alternative configurations.</p><p>The results given in the remainder of this chapter may be developed via the latter method by introducing an action whose stationary solution yields the field equation (6). Here we attempt to arrive at the same conclusions via more elementary arguments based on analogies to known results for the statistical mechanics of a quantum oscillator with dissipation. Fluctuation dissipation theorem We begin with a brief review of the statistical properties of an oscillator with a linear response function defined as <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{w}=x_{\omega} / f_{\omega},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the amplitude and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the external force. From the standard equation of motion of a simple damped oscillator, we find <span class="math display">\[\alpha_{\omega}^{-1}=\alpha^{-1}\left(1-\frac{i \omega}{\Gamma}-\frac{\omega^{2}}{\Omega^{2}}\right)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the static response function, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is the free resonance frequency and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> describes damping. In the zero damping limit, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma / \Omega \rightarrow \infty,\)</span> the imaginary part <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Im} \alpha_{\omega}\)</span> reduces to two delta functions centred on <span class="math inline">\(\pm \Omega\)</span> with weights 土<span class="math inline">\(\Omega / 2 .\)</span> From the well known mean energy of an oscillator, we may then express the variance of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as an integral over frequency in the form <span class="math display">\[\overline{x^{2}}=\frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} d \omega\left(\frac{1}{2}+n_{\omega}\right) \operatorname{lm} \alpha_{\omega}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n_{\omega}=\left( e ^{\omega / T}-1\right)^{-1}\)</span> is the Bose function. We adopt a system of units in which <span class="math inline">\(\hbar=k_{ B }=1\)</span> throughout. This simply means that energy, frequency and temperature are measured in the same way (e.g. in milli-electron-volts). It is clear from <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Im} \alpha_{\omega},\)</span> with zero damping that eq. (8) does indeed yield the expected results <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^{-1} \overline{x^{2}}=\left((1 / 2)+n_{\Omega}\right) \Omega\)</span> for the thermal energy of a quantum oscillator at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. The first term is the zero point contribution. The second is the thermal part, which is a consequence of quantisation followed by averaging over an ensemble at finite <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span></p><p>The last result for the variance of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (in terms of <span class="math inline">\(n_{\Omega}\)</span> ) holds only for zero damping. But eq. (8) is completely general. It holds not only for eq. (7) but also for an arbitrary linear response function and in the presence of anharmonicities. This universal result is known as the fluctuation dissipation (Nyquist's) theorem (Landau and Lifshitz 1980 ), which is well known in connection with the related problem of Johnson noise. It provides us with a direct way of quantising the field at a level sufficient for our discussion of the variance of <span class="math inline">\(m ,\)</span> and hence of the temperature dependence of the susceptibility.</p><h5 id="thermal-population-for-over-damped-modes">Thermal population for over-damped modes</h5><p>We are interested in a susceptibility of the form of eq. (5b) which corresponds to eq. (7) in the extreme over-damping limit <span class="math inline">\(\Omega / \Gamma \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. In this case, it proves useful to introduce a dimensionless thermal population defined as <span class="math inline">\(n(\Gamma / T)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\overline{x_{ T }^{2}} / \Gamma \alpha,\)</span> where the subscript <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> denotes the thermal part (i.e. the second term on the right-hand side of eq.

We see that the high- <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> limits are of the same qualitative form. But at low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, in place of an exponential freezing out of the population, we find, for the over-damped limit, a more gradual quadratic temperature dependence. The form of <span class="math inline">\(n(\Gamma / T)\)</span> will play a crucial role in our discussion of the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid exponents in section 6.4</p><h5 id="entropy-of-dissipative-modes">Entropy of dissipative modes</h5><p>For a discussion of the heat capacity, we shall also need to generalise the concept of the entropy of an oscillator to include the effects of damping. We begin with a closed system consisting of an oscillator coupled to a reservoir. For sufficiently strong coupling, the standard treatment of the oscillator as a well defined normal mode breaks down. Nevertheless, the shift of the entropy of the closed system as a whole due to this coupling may be calculated in principle using conventional statistical mechanics. We now define the entropy of the damped oscillator to include this shift as if it were entirely the property of the oscillator itself, and attempt to express it in terms of the final oscillator response function <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\omega}\)</span> (Lonzarich <span class="math inline">\(1986 ;\)</span> Pippard <span class="math inline">\(1987 ;\)</span> Edwards and Lonzarich 1992 ). The required generalisation for the entropy is found to be <span class="math display">\[S=\int_{0}^{\infty} d \omega S_{\omega}\left(\operatorname{Im} \frac{\partial \ln \alpha_{\omega}}{\pi \partial \omega}\right)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S_{\omega}\)</span> is the usual entropy of an undamped oscillator of frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega .\)</span> The latter may be obtained from <span class="math inline">\(n_{\omega}\)</span> via the relation <span class="math inline">\(T \partial S_{\omega} / \partial T=\omega \partial n_{\omega} / \partial T\)</span></p><p>To gain some understanding of this result, let us consider a model in which the average potential and kinetic energies are <span class="math inline">\(\overline{x^{2}} / 2 \alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\dot{x}^{2}} / 2 \alpha \Omega^{2},\)</span> respectively. From Nyquist's theorem applied to both <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dot{x}\)</span>, we arrive at a thermal energy given by <span class="math inline">\((1 / 2 \alpha)\)</span> times the right-hand side of eq. ( 8 ), but with a factor <span class="math inline">\(\left(1+\left(\omega^{2} / \Omega^{2}\right)\right)\)</span> in the integral. It is now straightforward to show that this thermal energy yields an entropy of the form (10) for a (temperature-independent) <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\omega}\)</span> given by eq. (7). The result for <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is more general than this analysis would suggest. In particular, eq. ( 10 ) holds for an arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\omega} .\)</span> But, in contrast to Nyquist's theorem, it may be limited to low temperatures except, as discussed in section <span class="math inline">\(6.3 .4,\)</span> when the mean field approximation is appropriate. The last factor in eq. ( 10 ) reduces to <span class="math inline">\(\delta(\omega-\Omega)\)</span> for no damping <span class="math inline">\((\Gamma / \Omega \rightarrow \infty)\)</span> and to <span class="math inline">\((\Gamma / \pi) /\left(\omega^{2}+\Gamma^{2}\right)\)</span> in the opposite limit of over-damping, when only the lowest imaginary pole of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\omega}\)</span> in eq. (7) is retained. The Lorentzian form is quite natural and reflects the spectral composition of an amplitude which does not oscillate, but decays exponentially with a rate <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma .\)</span> since only the low-frequency pole is retained, the integrated weight is here <span class="math inline">\(1 / 2\)</span> and not unity. Also, we note that the contribution of the <span class="math inline">\(\omega^{2} / \Omega^{2}\)</span> term discussed above vanishes in this limit, so that the energy is now essentially purely potential.</p><h5 id="heat-capacity-of-over-damped-modes">Heat capacity of over-damped modes</h5><p>For the problem of interest here, in which the relevant oscillator modes are strongly damped, the heat capacity <span class="math inline">\(C=T \partial S / \partial T\)</span> takes a particularly simple form: <span class="math display">\[C=\frac{\Gamma}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial T} n\left(\frac{\Gamma}{T}\right)\]</span> This follows directly from eq.

( 11 ) and (9) yield, for the same limits, <span class="math inline">\(1 / 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((\pi / 3) T / \Gamma,\)</span> respectively. The difference at high <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> arises from the fact that an over-damped oscillator, as we have said, has only potential energy. At low temperatures, instead of an exponential collapse of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> we find, in the overdamped limit, a linear heat capacity. The latter will be related in section 6.4 to the renormalisation of the quasi-particle mass in the Fermi liquid state.</p><h4 id="mean-field-approximation-for-the-mode-mode-coupling">6.3.4 Mean field approximation for the mode-mode coupling</h4><p>With the above background for the statistical mechanics of a dissipative mode, we are now ready to deal with the exchange field, which, as we have stressed, corresponds to an open system strongly coupled to a reservoir, i.e. the fermions are now filtered from view. We think of each Fourier component of this field as an oscillator variable, or mode. Each mode, labelled by a cartesian component <span class="math inline">\((x, y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(z)\)</span> and the wave vector <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> is coupled not only to the reservoir, but also to other modes of the field. The latter, or the mode-mode coupling, arises in the model through the anharmonic terms in the field equation (6)</p><p>Our basic strategy is to deal with the coupling to the bath via the formalism developed in the preceding section for dissipative modes, and the coupling between modes themselves by the mean field approximation. The latter assumes that (i) the modes are statistically independent and that (ii) the characteristic energy (in our case <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> eq. <span class="math inline">\(\left.(5 d )\right)\)</span> for any one mode depends on the thermal population <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}=n\left(\Gamma_{q} / T\right)\)</span> of all other modes <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in a self-consistent fashion. since each mode includes corrections due to interaction with the others, the thermal energy of the field is not additive. But because of assumed statistical independence, the entropy itself is additive and is thus more convenient to use than the thermal energy. This is the chief reason for our focus on the entropy in the preceding section.</p><p>Thus, we arrive at a picture of a collection of independent dissipative modes described by a relaxation spectrum which depends, in the mean field approximation for the effect of anharmonicities, on the thermal population. since the latter also depends on the spectrum, we are led to a self-consistent equation for the temperature variation of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> and hence of the thermal properties, in terms of the <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> parameters alone.</p><p>We begin with a discussion of the heat capacity, assuming <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> is known at each <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> and only later consider how the temperature dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> may be determined from the anharmonicities built into the field equation. Finally, we shall consider the validity of the mean field approximation itself.</p><h5 id="heat-capacity">Heat capacity</h5><p>If the modes of the field can be treated as statistically independent in the above sense, then the entropy of the field reduces to the sum of contributions of the form ( 10 ). In the limit of strong dissipation, we then obtain from eq. ( 11 ) a heat capacity <span class="math display">\[\Delta C=\frac{3}{2} \sum_{q} \Gamma_{q} \frac{\partial n_{q}}{\partial T}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> are the spectrum and population given, respectively, by eqs. (5) and (9). The factor of 3 in eq. (12) represents the degeneracy for each <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, i.e. the three cartesian components for the field, assumed to be equivalent throughout. since <span class="math inline">\(n\left(\Gamma_{q} / T\right)\)</span> varies as <span class="math inline">\(T^{2} / \Gamma_{q}^{2}\)</span> in the low- <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> limit, eq. ( 12 ) seems to lead to a shift in the linear heat capacity by an amount proportional to the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space average of <span class="math inline">\(1 / \Gamma_{q} .\)</span> In this case, interactions do not alter the qualitative temperature dependence of the system in lowest order in <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> but lead only to a renormalisation of the linear coefficient.</p><p>This analysis is clearly incomplete. We have ignored the temperature dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> and the fact that, for any finite <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> there may exist a range in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> at small <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> for which the assumption <span class="math inline">\(T \ll \Gamma_{q}\)</span> breaks down. As we shall see in section <span class="math inline">\(6.4,\)</span> the latter in particular can lead to anomalous corrections to the linear heat capacity which have no counterpart in the non-interacting electron system, and in extreme cases can also give rise to a leading temperature dependence which is qualitatively different from that of the conventional Fermi liquid. since these are associated with the low- <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> behaviour of the sum in eq.(12), they may be called infrared anomalies.</p><h5 id="non-linear-effects-of-the-exchange-field">Non-linear effects of the exchange field</h5><p>We now turn to the more difficult task of evaluating the temperature dependence of the spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> or, in particular, of the most sensitive variable in <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> namely the susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>.</p><p>In our treatment in section <span class="math inline">\(6.3 .2,\)</span> we have taken into account that part of the exchange field which follows the average <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the presence of <span class="math inline">\(H .\)</span> There also exists a spontaneous stochastic component with zero mean which drives random fluctuations in the local magnetisation. In the absence of anharmonicities, this additional field would have no consequences for the ensemble average of the field equation, and the results of section 6.3 .2 would remain unchanged. But this is not the case in the presence of terms non-linear in the magnetisation, which appear in eq. (6) both via precession and damping.</p><p>To see what can happen, let us look first at the static field equation (1). In the presence of a random exchange field <span class="math inline">\(h,\)</span> we may make the substitution <span class="math inline">\(H \rightarrow H+h\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow M+m,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the additional component induced by <span class="math inline">\(h .\)</span> Taking an ensemble average with <span class="math inline">\(\bar{h}=\bar{m}=0,\)</span> we see that only the cubic term <span class="math inline">\((M+m)^{3}\)</span> gives a non-vanishing contribution through the averages <span class="math inline">\(3 b M \overline{m^{2}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \overline{m^{3}}\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{m^{2}}\)</span> is finite even as <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow 0,\)</span> while <span class="math inline">\(\overline{m^{3}}\)</span> must vanish in this limit.</p><p>In general, these moments lead to corrections to all terms in <span class="math inline">\(H[M] .\)</span> In the mean field approximation, only the second moment as <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow 0\)</span> is retained. This then leads to a shift of the sensitive linear term in <span class="math inline">\(H[M]\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(a+3 b \overline{m^{2}}\)</span>.</p><p>The same statistical analysis may now be carried out for the vector model, which includes a second independent type of anharmonicity, i.e. non-linear precession. The averaging over the random field is facilitated by first inverting eq. (6) to express <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(M, \nabla^{2} M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dot{M}\)</span>. This is achieved by taking the cross-product of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with each side of eq. (6), rearranging and dropping terms beyond second order in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the cross-product. Making the substitutions <span class="math inline">\(H \rightarrow H + h\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow M + m ,\)</span> and averaging with <span class="math inline">\(\overline{ h }=\overline{ m }=0,\)</span> we then find that the coefficients of the linear and cubic terms in <span class="math inline">\(H[M]\)</span> are now replaced by <span class="math inline">\(a+\Delta a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b+\Delta b,\)</span> where and <span class="math display">\[\Delta a=\frac{5}{3}\left(b+\frac{\Delta b}{2}\right) \overline{|m|^{2}}-\zeta \gamma^{-2} * \nabla_{M} \overline{m \times \dot{m}}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\Delta b=\frac{14}{3} g \overline{| m |^{2}}\]</span> As in the scalar model, the <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> dependences of the moments of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are not retained. The shift in <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> arises qualitatively from the same origin as the earlier shift in <span class="math inline">\(a,\)</span> but now from a fifth-order term in <span class="math inline">\(H[M]\)</span> of the form <span class="math inline">\(g M(M \cdot M)^{2}\)</span> The latter must be retained when <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is negative or, as in the case of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> itself, nearly critical. The only qualitatively new term is the last one in eq. (13a) due to non-linear precession. Here <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^{-1} *\)</span> is the inverse of the operation <span class="math inline">\(\gamma *\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{M}\)</span> denotes a gradient in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the limit <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> We retain the first gradient because it leads to corrections of the same order in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> as that of the mean field approximation.</p><p>The precession correction (the last term in <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> ) is strictly negative and grows in magnitude with increasing <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. This is in contrast with the first term, whose sign depends on <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, which can be positive or negative depending, for example, on the form of the density of states of non-interacting fermions at the Fermi level. It is interesting that thermal fluctuations in the presence of non-linear precession alone tend to promote rather than to destroy magnetic order, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> in the paramagnetic state would in this case grow rather than fall with increasing <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Eventually, the effects of more conventional anharmonicities in <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> (e.g. the <span class="math inline">\(|m|^{2}\)</span> term in eq. ( <span class="math inline">\(\left.13 a \right)\)</span> ) will dominate and lead to a downturn in <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> at high <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span></p><p>The ubiquitous peaks in <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> observed in nearly magnetic metals normally arise essentially from a negative <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> with positive higher-order coefficients such as <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in eq. <span class="math inline">\((13 b) .\)</span> But, as the above argument suggests, a peak can also arise if <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is positive but sufficiently small for the precession correction in <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> to dominate at low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. We note, however, that for fermions with a simple parabolic spectrum, we expect the first term in eq. (13a) to be positive and entirely dominant over the precession correction (Ramakrishnan <span class="math inline">\(1974 ;\)</span> McMullan 1989 ).</p><h5 id="susceptibility">Susceptibility</h5><p>For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the <span class="math inline">\(\overline{|m|^{2}}\)</span> term in eq. (13a), which defines the mean field approximation for the susceptibility. Our goal is to express this in terms of the population <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> parameters alone. We note that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{|m|^{2}}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space sum per unit volume of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\left|m_{q}\right|^{2}}\)</span> and that the latter is given via Nyquist's theorem (8) in terms of the generalised susceptibility in eq. (5). The thermal component of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{|m|^{2}}\)</span> is now seen to be explicitly a function of <span class="math inline">\(n_{q},\)</span> eq. (9), while the zero point part is implicitly a function of this quantity through the correction (13) to <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> which defines <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q} .\)</span> Our procedure is to expand the zero point part to first order in <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> and solve for <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> self-consistently.</p><p>In leading order in <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> the shift of <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> from its <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> value <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is then found to be <span class="math display">\[\Delta a=5 b \hat{\sum_{q}} \gamma_{q} n_{q}=5 b  \hat{\sum_{q}} \gamma_{q} n\left(\frac{\gamma_{q}}{T}\left(a+\Delta a+c q^{2}\right)\right)\]</span> where $ $ denotes a sum per unit volume. The <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are now as renormalised by the effects of zero point fluctuations (see also, e.g., Solontsov and Wagner 1995 ). From the explicit form of <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> (eq. (9)) and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> (eqs. <span class="math inline">\((5 d , e )),\)</span> we see that eq. (14) is an implicit equation for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a,\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1},\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and the basic parameters of the model <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span></p><p>We note that, since <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(T^{2} / \Gamma_{q}^{2}\)</span> at low <span class="math inline">\(T, \Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> might be expected to vary initially as <span class="math inline">\(T^{2} .\)</span> This corresponds to the normal Fermi liquid regime. since <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1} / T^{2}\)</span> depends on <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space averages of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{q} / \Gamma_{q}^{2},\)</span> it tends to be even more strongly enhanced as the critical point is approached than the linear heat capacity <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C / T,\)</span> which depends on an average of <span class="math inline">\(1 / \Gamma_{q} .\)</span> But as we shall see, sufficiently close to the critical point, where infrared fluctuations are important, the above qualitative temperature dependence will, in general, break down.</p><p>In summary, we have arrived at a simple model for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> which depends on the population <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> parameters. since <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> is a function of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> itself, we obtain a self-consistent equation, the solution of which yields the temperature dependence of the susceptibility and hence of the spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> From the latter we may then obtain <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> from eq. ( 12 ) and also, as shown in the next section, the electrical resistivity <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> of the fermions in leading order in perturbation theory.</p><h5 id="resistivity">Resistivity</h5><p>For an analysis of the electrical resistivity we now return to description (I), in which fermions interact with the exchange field via a potential <span class="math inline">\(-\mu \cdot \lambda m\)</span>. The rate of scattering of fermions with the field may be determined in perturbation theory, and the resistivity is then obtained by means of the Boltzmann transport equation, as in the case of phonon scattering (Moriya 1985 ).</p><p>A standard analysis in the Born approximation then leads to a resistivity, which may be expressed as <span class="math display">\[\Delta \rho=\eta \sum_{q} q^{k}\left(\frac{T \partial n_{q}}{\partial T}\right)_{\Gamma}\]</span> where normally <span class="math inline">\(k=2,\)</span> the suffix <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> denotes a derivative at constant <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> depends on the strength of the coupling between the fermions and the exchange field, which is essentially temperature independent at the level of approximation employed. <span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> This result has a plausible form. The factor in the brackets in eq. (15) is simply proportional to <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> in leading order in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and reflects the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> grows with increasing thermal disorder. On the other hand, the <span class="math inline">\(q^{2}\)</span> factor describes the fact that fluctuations of high <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> which produce scattering at large angles, should be more effective in reducing the current than those at low <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> that scatter fermions only at low angles. We note that eq. (15) is of the same form as for phonon scattering if by <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> we mean the Bose function evaluated at the phonon propagation frequency <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{q}\)</span></p><p>In leading order in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> we expect <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> to vary as <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> times a <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space average of <span class="math inline">\(q^{2} / \Gamma_{q}^{2}\)</span>. We see that, in the Fermi liquid regime, the quadratic coefficient is even more strongly enhanced than the linear coefficient of the heat capacity, which depends on an average of <span class="math inline">\(1 / \Gamma_{q}\)</span></p><p>The above analysis is, however, incomplete for the reasons given in our discussion of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span>. As we shall show in section <span class="math inline">\(6.4,\)</span> the Fermi liquid form of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> and that of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> can break down under certain conditions, which lead to the infrared anomalies.</p><h5 id="extensions-of-the-model">Extensions of the model</h5><p>For completeness, we also note that, when the anharmonicity parameter <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is small or negative, it may be necessary to retain the additional correction in eqs. (13a) and (13b) even at low temperatures. An analysis similar to that outlined above yields an expression for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> equivalent to eq. (14), but with the parameter <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in the right-hand side replaced by <span class="math inline">\(b+(\Delta b / 2),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta b\)</span> is now the shift of the cubic coefficient in <span class="math inline">\(H(M)\)</span> from its <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> value, <span class="math display">\[\Delta b=14 g \hat{\sum_{q}} \gamma_{q} n_{q}\]</span> In the limit of small <span class="math inline">\(b,\)</span> we must also take account of the non-linear precession term in eq. (13a), the qualitative effects of which have already been discussed. Throughout, we have assumed that the number of equivalent field components for each <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is 3 . It is straightforward to generalise our analysis for an arbitrary number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. The result is that the numerical factors 3,5 and 14 in eqs.(12), (14) and (16) are replaced respectively, by <span class="math inline">\(N, 2+N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(8+2 N\)</span>. It is also useful to extend the results, where possible, to describe fluctuations which are nearly critical about some large wave vector <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> near the Brillouin zone boundary rather than, as we have assumed thus far, about the origin. In this case, we may shift origin in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space, <span class="math inline">\(q \rightarrow Q+q,\)</span> and continue to use the above model, but with the following minimal modifications (Moriya 1985 ). since in lowest order in <span class="math inline">\(q, \gamma_{Q+q} \cong \gamma_{Q}\)</span> is a finite constant, we may take <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to be zero in eq. (5e). Furthermore, since <span class="math inline">\(|Q+q|^{2}\)</span> is also a constant in leading order in <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> the exponent <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho,\)</span> eq. <span class="math inline">\((15),\)</span> similarly reduces to zero. Finally, the susceptibility and anharmonicity parameters, eqs. ( 14 ), ( 16 ), must now be considered to correspond to the anti-ferromagnetic magnetisation at wave vector <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. This extension to the case of incipient anti-ferromagnetism has not been tested experimentally as thoroughly as for the ferromagnetic counterpart. In particular, the range of validity of the model of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> is now more restricted than for the latter, and the assumptions in section 6.3 .2 on the analytical properties of the relevant magnetic equation of state may apply only to the simplest examples of conductors near anti-ferromagnetic instabilities (Hlubina and Rice 1995 ; Anderson <span class="math inline">\(1997 a\)</span> ).</p><h5 id="range-of-validity-of-the-mean-field-approximation---a-general-ginzburg-criterion">Range of validity of the mean field approximation - a general Ginzburg criterion</h5><p>We conclude our technical discussion with a brief examination of corrections to the mean field approximation for the mode-mode coupling. The key result is that the latter should break down qualitatively in a finite interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T_{ G }\)</span> near <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(d \leqslant 4 .\)</span> But this interval vanishes more rapidly than <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c } \rightarrow 0,\)</span> if the effective dimension <span class="math inline">\(d+z\)</span> exceeds <span class="math inline">\(4,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is the dynamical exponent. The latter gives the leading <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{ q } \propto q^{z}\)</span> near the critical point and for our model, eqs. <span class="math inline">\((5 d , e ),\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(2+n .\)</span> The conclusion is that when <span class="math inline">\(d+z&gt;4,\)</span> the mean field model is expected to be qualitatively correct for describing quantum critical phenomena (Hertz 1976; Millis 1993; Sachdev 1996) The effective dimension is now greater than the spatial dimension which enters the classical theory, because a quantum description must be based not on a free energy for a spatially varying variable, but rather on an action for an order parameter which depends on both space and an effective time (Tsvelik 1995). The contribution of the latter is, in general, not equivalent to that of a space dimension unless the dynamical exponent <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> which relates space and time in the spectrum is unity.</p><p>The first correction we wish to consider is the last term in eq. ( 13 ), which arises from non-linear precession. A calculation analogous to that given above shows that this correction has the same initial temperature dependence as that of the first term, and that, for a parabolic band model for the fermions, its magnitude is small and ignorable (McMullan 1989). As we have already discussed, however, non-linear precession can play an important role when the anharmonicity parameter <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is small.</p><p>The next correction arises from the dependence of the variance of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> on the average magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. If we expand <span class="math inline">\(\overline{m^{2}}\)</span> in a power series in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the scalar model discussed earlier, we obtain a correction to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> of the form <span class="math inline">\(\Delta b=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(3 b \partial \overline{m^{2}} / \partial\left(M^{2}\right),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{m^{2}}\)</span> includes both zero point and thermal contributions, and the derivative is evaluated for <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> The <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> dependence appears in <span class="math inline">\(\overline{m^{2}}\)</span> through the inverse susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\partial H / \partial M=a+3 b M^{2} .\)</span> From Nyquist's theorem and our model for <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{k}\)</span> (eq.

Thus, the sum of <span class="math inline">\(T \chi_{q}^{2}\)</span> which is singular for <span class="math inline">\(d \leqslant 4,\)</span> is replaced by a sum over <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q} \chi_{q}^{2}=\gamma_{q} \chi_{q},\)</span> which is singular only if <span class="math inline">\(d+z \leqslant 4\)</span></p><p>In conclusion, the mean field approximation for the mode-mode coupling is more stable for quantum than for classical phase transitions, and, in the absence of new instabilities, the predictions of the model discussed in the preceding section may be expected to be qualitatively correct in essentially all cases considered.</p><h2 id="predictions-and-comparisons-with-experiment">6.4 Predictions and comparisons with experiment</h2><p>In this final section, the predictions of the model developed in section 6.3 will be summarised and briefly compared with observations. The Fermi liquid limit of the model has already been mentioned, and our focus will be mainly on its breakdown, which, in the language of description (II), may be attributed either to the long range or to the attractive nature of the induced fermion-fermion interaction.</p><p>It is useful to summarise the key elements of the model which we shall need to carry with us in this section. The central quantity is the spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> (eqs. <span class="math inline">\((5 d , e )),\)</span> which defines the population <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}=n\left(\Gamma_{q} / T\right)( eq .(9)) .\)</span> From this and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{q},\)</span> we arrive at a self-consistent equation for the susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\chi,\)</span> eq. (14). The latter yields the temperature dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> and hence of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> (eq. (12)) and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho( eq \cdot(15)) .\)</span> The effective induced interaction between fermions, which we shall need explicitly to discuss the pair instability, can be shown to be given by the real part of the generalised susceptibility, equation (5), which is also fully determined by the above procedure.</p><h4 id="general-form-of-low-temperature-exponents">6.4 .1 General form of low-temperature exponents</h4><p>We consider first in a general way the prediction of the model for the temperature dependences in the low-temperature limit. In all cases, this is given by a <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> space average of the population <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> weighted by a <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -dependent factor of the form <span class="math inline">\(q^{m}\)</span> at low <span class="math inline">\(q .\)</span> Thus, for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho, m\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k,\)</span> respectively (see eqs. (5e), (14) and (15)). For <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span>, the low- <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> form of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> leads to a value of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> equal to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> away from the critical point, but to <span class="math inline">\(z=2+n\)</span> near the critical point when <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> can be essentially ignored.</p><p>From our expression for the population (9), we find that the required sum in <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> dimensions reduces to <span class="math display">\[\sum_{q} q^{m} n_{q} \propto T^{s} \int_{0}^{x_{\varepsilon}} \frac{x^{s-2} d x}{1+x}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\((d+m) / n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\((d+m) / z,\)</span> respectively, for the above two limits of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_{ c }\)</span> is a cut-off inversely proportional to <span class="math inline">\(T .\)</span> This simple result describes in a compact way all of the predictions of the model for the asymptotic lowtemperature exponents for the susceptibility, heat capacity and resistivity in the paramagnetic state.</p><h4 id="the-fermi-liquid">6.4 .2 The Fermi liquid</h4><p>We consider first the most common limit <span class="math inline">\(s&gt;2,\)</span> which is normally appropriate for <span class="math inline">\(d&gt;2\)</span> well away from the critical point. In this case, the integral in eq. (19) is determined by the upper cut-off <span class="math inline">\(x_{ c } \propto 1 / T .\)</span> In leading order in <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> we see that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> drops out and eq. (19) reduces to the universal <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> form which is independent of <span class="math inline">\(d, m\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(n .\)</span> This is the behaviour of <span class="math inline">\(T \Delta C, \Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> in the normal Fermi liquid description, which, as we have stressed, characterises the vast majority of conducting systems at low temperature, but above the temperature at which pairs are formed.</p><p>These temperature dependences are qualitatively the same as that for noninteracting or weakly interacting fermions. But the corrections to the linear heat capacity are in general not qualitatively the same as for non-interacting fermions. Thus, for <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> of the Landau damping form away from the critical point in three dimensions and with three components of <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> eqs. <span class="math inline">\((5 d , e ),(9)\)</span> and (12) yield <span class="math display">\[\Delta C=\alpha T+\beta T^{3} \ln \left(T / T^{*}\right)+\cdots\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[\alpha=\pi \sum_{q}\left(1 / \Gamma_{q}\right)\]</span> The second term in eq. (20a), which has no counterpart in a non-interacting system, arises from the behaviour of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> at low <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and is an example of an infrared anomaly discussed earlier. The existence of the <span class="math inline">\(T^{3} \ln \left(T / T^{*}\right)\)</span> term is well established for liquid <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3} He\)</span> in the normal state (Baym and Pethick 1991 ). But in metals the range of validity of this term can be small, and a comparison with experiment beyond leading order in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> normally requires a numerical integration of eq. (12). We note that, for our model, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=\ln \left(1+c \chi q_{ c }^{2}\right) / 4 \pi \gamma c, \beta=2 \pi \chi^{3} / 5 \gamma^{3},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T^{*}\)</span> is of the order of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma /\left(c \chi^{3}\right)^{1 / 2}\)</span>. If we substitute for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> the parameters appropriate for non-interacting fermions with a parabolic spectrum, we arrive, via a new route, precisely at the results of the paramagnon theory originally developed for the normal state of liquid <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He (Izuyama et al. <span class="math inline">\(1963 ;\)</span> Berk and Schrieffer 1966; Doniach and Engelsberg 1966; Béal-Monod et al. 1968; Brinkman and Engelsberg 1968 and others).</p><p>The coefficient of the first term in eq. (20a) is a measure of the enhancement of the quasi-particle mass due to the induced interaction associated with the exchange field in this model. We see that a heavy fermion state is favoured where <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> is small over a wide range in <span class="math inline">\(q .\)</span> For our form <span class="math inline">\((5 d )\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> this is expected near the instability where <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> is small and in systems where the stiffness <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is small. These conditions are met in some d-transition-metals which are both near the middle of the series and on the border of magnetic instabilities, and especially in many f-metals.</p><p>The above model for the linear coefficient has provided a quantitative description of heavy quasi-particle masses observed in the nearly magnetic dmetals (Lonzarich 1986 ). It may also offer a useful starting point for describing the more strongly renormalised masses in many f systems.</p><p>We have arrived at a model of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> via an unconventional route, namely description (III) of dissipative modes of the interaction field. It may seem from this viewpoint that our attribution of the excess linear term, eqs. <span class="math inline">\((20 a , b ),\)</span> to fermion quasi-particles has only a formal significance. However, it can be shown via descriptions (I) or (II) that the elementary excitations of the combined system of fermions and exchange field are indeed fermions again, but with a renormalised mass given by the starting mass plus a correction consistent with eqs. <span class="math inline">\((20 a , b )\)</span></p><p>Direct experimental evidence in support of the existence of such quasiparticles with extraordinarily high effective masses has been collected in the last decade in a number of d-metals (Taillefer et al. 1986 ) and f-metal heavy fermion compounds (see chapter <span class="math inline">\(8 ;\)</span> also Reinders et al. 1986; Taillefer and Lonzarich 1988 ; Aoki et al. 1993 and others).</p><p>In a few cases, these investigations, via quantum oscillatory phenomena in intense magnetic fields and very low temperatures, have established that the contribution to the linear heat capacity expected to arise from the quasi-particle system as a whole (Fulde et al. 1988 ) is indeed comparable to that actually observed in bulk heat capacity experiments (Julian <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. 1997a). These findings, together with theoretical analyses of the heat capacity via eq. (20) directly, have helped to confirm the consistency of results obtained from the different starting descriptions (I) to (III).</p><h4 id="non-fermi-liquids">6.4.3 Non-Fermi liquids</h4><p>Let us now return to the original <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space sum (19) and consider the opposite case where the exponent <span class="math inline">\(s \leqslant 2 .\)</span> In contrast to the results of the previous subsection, we now find that the upper cut-off <span class="math inline">\(x_{ c }\)</span> does not play the dominant role. The case <span class="math inline">\(s=2\)</span> is marginal and eq. (19) yields again a universal function, independent of <span class="math inline">\(d, n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> but now of the non-analytic form <span class="math inline">\(T^{2} \ln \left(T^{*} / T\right)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T^{*}\)</span> is a constant. For <span class="math inline">\(s&lt;2,\)</span> the relevant exponent is non-universal and falls below that of the usual Fermi liquid model. For <span class="math inline">\(1&lt;s&lt;2,\)</span> in particular, eq. ( 19 ) is well defined and varies as <span class="math inline">\(T^{y}\)</span> at low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p><p>The limit <span class="math inline">\(s&lt;2\)</span> may be satisfied in reduced dimensions in general or in three dimensions near a critical point where <span class="math inline">\(s=(d+m) / z, z=2+n .\)</span> Let us consider first the latter in the presence of Landau damping so that <span class="math inline">\(d=z=3\)</span>. From eq. (19), we may immediately infer that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C, \Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> have leading temperature dependences of the form <span class="math inline">\(T \ln \left(T^{*} / T\right), T^{4 / 3},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T^{5 / 3},\)</span> respectively. This defines a state known as the marginal Fermi liquid. (The <span class="math inline">\(T^{5 / 3}\)</span> form for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> was first obtained by Mathon <span class="math inline">\((1968) .)\)</span> Note that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> has precisely the marginal value of 2 for <span class="math inline">\(T \Delta C,\)</span> which may be obtained from eq. (19) when we set <span class="math inline">\(m=z\)</span>. The latter limit has provided a useful framework for describing certain dmetals near ferromagnetic instabilities at low temperature (Pfleiderer et al. 1994,<span class="math inline">\(1995 ;\)</span> Grosche <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. <span class="math inline">\(1995 ;\)</span> Thessieu <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. 1995 ). The marginal Fermi liquid model has also appeared in theoretical treatments of the very weak, but long-range, Lorentz interaction of moving charges in an ideal conductor (Holstein <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. <span class="math inline">\(1973 ;\)</span> Reizer 1989 ). Furthermore, a state with the same <span class="math inline">\(T \ln \left(T^{*} / T\right)\)</span> form for the heat capacity has been introduced in the study of the normal state of the high-temperature superconductors (Varma et al. 1989 ).</p><p>The departure from the Fermi liquid form is even more extreme near a critical point in lower dimensions. Thus, for <span class="math inline">\(z=3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d=2,\)</span> eq. (19) yields <span class="math inline">\(T^{2 / 3}, T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T^{4 / 3},\)</span> respectively, for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C, \Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho .\)</span> These results for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> have also been obtained by a different technique for a two-dimensional system in which the critical fluctuations are not of the magnetisation, but of a higher-order object, known as a chiral field (Lee and Nagaosa 1992 )</p><p>We also consider briefly the implications of this model for the nearly antiferromagnetic metals discussed at the end of section 6.3 for which, effectively, <span class="math inline">\(n=k=0\)</span> (Moriya 1985). At the critical point, therefore, the dynamical exponent is <span class="math inline">\(z=2 .\)</span> In three dimensions, we find from eq. (19) that the heat capacity is linear in first order, as expected for a Fermi liquid. However, the linear coefficient can be very large, particularly when the stiffness <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is small, as in the heavy fermion <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> -metals. Furthermore, the correction to the leading term has the anomalous form <span class="math inline">\(T^{3 / 2}\)</span>. Thus, the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C / T\)</span> can show a marked upturn at low temperature, which, as numerical analyses suggest, can resemble, over a wide range in temperature, the divergence associated with a non-Fermi liquid state. We also note that both <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi_{Q}^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> are (from eq. (19)) now expected to have a <span class="math inline">\(T^{3 / 2}\)</span> temperature dependence, which differs from that of the usual Fermi liquid. <span class="math inline">\(^{\dagger}\)</span></p><p>We note that in all of the examples considered above the requirements <span class="math inline">\(d+z&gt;4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s&gt;1\)</span> are indeed satisfied. <span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> In lower dimensions, one or both of these may be violated and the treatment given here then breaks down. In a onedimensional conductor, this leads us to the Luttinger liquid state which lies outside of the present framework (Anderson <span class="math inline">\(1997 b\)</span> ).</p><h4 id="magnetic-instability">6.4 .4 Magnetic instability</h4><p>The great abundance of systems which appear to be on the border of longrange magnetic order, and for which therefore the models of the last section are relevant, is, at first sight, surprising. Part of the explanation lies in the role of the anharmonicities in the field equation, which, in the presence of zero point and thermal fluctuations, generally tend to suppress <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> below the value <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }^{0}\)</span> in the absence of either anharmonicities or fluctuations. In our model, <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }^{0}\)</span> is essentially given by the condition <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}-\lambda=0,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}\)</span> is the temperaturedependent inverse Pauli susceptibility of the non-interacting fermions. The final <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> is then given by <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}-\lambda+\Delta a=0,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> is the correction, eq. (13) which arises from the combined effect of anharmonicities and of spontaneous fluctuations. For sufficiently large fluctuations, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> is, in general, positive, and hence <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> is driven down below <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }^{0}\)</span></p><p>This suppression of <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> increases with decreasing dimension and with decreasing value of the stiffness <span class="math inline">\(c .\)</span> Among the low-dimensional systems, or in the heavy fermion f-metals where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is small, we therefore expect, and find, numerous examples of systems with low or vanishing magnetic critical points.</p><p>Even for three-dimensional d-metals, the reduction of the magnetic transition by fluctuations is very pronounced, and typically <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> is one or more orders of magnitude below <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }^{0}\)</span>. In such cases, where the temperature dependence of <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}\)</span> can be ignored, <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> may be obtained in our model by the condition <span class="math inline">\(a+\Delta a=0\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a constant and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> is given by eq. (14). From <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> (eqs. ( <span class="math inline">\(\left.\left.5 d , e \right)\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> (eq. (9)), we then find for <span class="math inline">\(d=3\)</span> and three equivalent components of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> are the basic parameters of the model and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is a pure number approximately equal to 2.39 for <span class="math inline">\(z=3\)</span> and 0.256 for <span class="math inline">\(z=2,\)</span> corresponding to the Curie and Néel transitions, respectively. This model has provided the starting point for our current understanding of magnetic transitions in conducting materials. For the low-temperature ferromagnets, it leads to predictions of <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> in close agreement with observation (Lonzarich 1984,1986 Lonzarich and Taillefer <span class="math inline">\(1985 ;\)</span> Takahashi and Moriya 1985 ).</p><p>The above treatment also allows us to determine the way in which <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> may depend on a control parameter such as pressure <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> about the critical <span class="math inline">\(p_{c},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> vanish. A leading order expansion of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is expected to be linear in <span class="math inline">\(\left(p-p_{ c }\right),\)</span> so that, from eq. (19) with <span class="math inline">\(m=n,\)</span> we find <span class="math display">\[T_{ c }^{(d+n) / z} \propto\left(p_{ c }-p\right)\]</span> For <span class="math inline">\(n=1, d=z=3,\)</span> the exponent of <span class="math inline">\(4 / 3\)</span> in eq. (22) is consistent with observation in a d-metal ferromagnet with a continuous phase transition near <span class="math inline">\(p_{c}\)</span> (Grosche et al. 1995).</p><p>It is important to note that the above treatments assume that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is positive and not very small. When this is not the case, the analysis must be extended to take account of the effects of higher-order anharmonicities (eqs. (13), (16)). The problem is then considerably more complicated, and near <span class="math inline">\(p_{c}\)</span> the phase transition may cross over from second to first order (Yamada 1993 ; Pfleiderer et al. 1995 ).</p><p>Finally, we note that eq. (14) for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> also allows us to understand the ubiquitous linear temperature dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> at high <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in d-metals. For the normal case, <span class="math inline">\(n=1, d=z=3, \chi^{-1}\)</span> varies as <span class="math inline">\(T^{4 / 3}\)</span> just above <span class="math inline">\(T_{c} .\)</span> With increasing <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1},\)</span> and hence <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> the curve bends below <span class="math inline">\(T^{4 / 3}\)</span> and, as confirmed by self-consistent numerical analysis, tends to stabilise at a linear temperature dependence over a wide range (Murata and Doniach 1972; Moriya and Kawabata <span class="math inline">\(1973 a , b )\)</span></p><h4 id="spin-fluctuation-mediated-interaction">6.4.5 Spin fluctuation mediated interaction</h4><p>The magnetic instability discussed above arises when <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is negative. From a somewhat unconventional point of view, this instability is due to a tendency of particles and holes of opposite spins to attract and pair. When <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is positive, the latter repel, but now an attractive induced interaction can arise between particles or between holes of the appropriate relative spins. This pairing now drives a pure system at sufficiently low temperature towards a superconducting instability. Thus, the normal states described in earlier sections are not expected to be the true ground states of the model we are considering.</p><p>The way the induced interaction arises via the exchange field has already been discussed qualitatively. Let us now consider the form of this interaction more quantitatively. Our goal is to determine the potential energy <span class="math inline">\(v(r)\)</span> of a fermion at <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> due to another at the origin. This potential, however, arises from the exchange of fields which propagate slowly. Thus, we are led to consider a potential energy per unit time <span class="math inline">\(v( r , t)\)</span> of a first fermion at <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> due to a second at the origin in both space and time. The first experiences an interaction with the exchange field of the form <span class="math inline">\(v(r, t)=-\mu \cdot \lambda m(r, t)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> arises from an effective field <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> produced by the second via a convolution with the non-local susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\chi(r, t) .\)</span> Taking <span class="math inline">\(h=\lambda \mu^{\prime} \delta(r) \delta(t),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{\prime}\)</span> is the moment of the second fermion, we then find <span class="math inline">\(v(r, t)=-\mu \cdot \mu^{\prime} \lambda^{2} \chi(r, t)\)</span> The final potential is the average of the latter plus the inverse process in which fermion 1 transmits an equivalent exchange field to fermion <span class="math inline">\(2 .^{*}\)</span> Thus we are led to a Fourier transform of <span class="math inline">\(v(r, t)\)</span> of the form <span class="math display">\[v_{q \omega}=-\mu \cdot \mu^{\prime} \lambda^{2} \operatorname{Re} \chi_{\varphi \omega}\]</span> where Re denotes the real part of <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{q \omega},\)</span> which is given by eq. (5).</p><p>We note that <span class="math inline">\(v_{q \omega}\)</span> is negative for particles of the same spin, and hence we might expect eq. (23) to lead only to pairing in the spin triplet state of necessarily odd parity. This conclusion is valid for our model (5) of a nearly ferromagnetic system <span class="math inline">\((c&gt;0),\)</span> for which the static non-local susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\chi(r)\)</span> is everywhere positive.</p><p>On the other hand, for an incipient anti-ferromagnet <span class="math inline">\((c&lt;0,\)</span> see below <span class="math inline">\(),\)</span> even where <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{q}\)</span> is everywhere positive, <span class="math inline">\(\chi(r)\)</span> oscillates and has a negative regime at small <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, which can favour the spin singlet state of even parity. It is interesting that, in this case, pairing can arise even when the transform (23) is everywhere greater than zero. A positive binding energy is achieved via the construction of an anisotropic pair wavefunction, which allows the particles to sample mainly the attractive regions of the space-time potential.</p><p>Also note that, for an adequate description of the latter, we now need to begin with a model for fermions and the exchange field which takes explicit account of the lattice. The potential now depends not only on the separation <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, but also on the coordinate <span class="math inline">\(r^{\prime}\)</span> of the second fermion. We may average over <span class="math inline">\(r^{\prime}\)</span> to obtain essentially <span class="math inline">\(v( r )\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{q}\)</span> as discussed above. In an extension of eq. (5), we replace expansions in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> by leading sinusoidal functions periodic in the crystalline lattice. For a simple cubic unit cell with side <span class="math inline">\(a, \chi_{q}^{-1}\)</span> in particular would then take the form <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}+\left(2 c / a^{2}\right)\left(3-\cos q_{x} a-\cos q_{y} a-\cos q_{z} a\right) .\)</span> Incipient ferromagnetism and anti-ferromagnetism can now be described in essentially the same model with positive and negative values of <span class="math inline">\(c,\)</span> respectively.</p><p>It is interesting to compare the above potential (eqs. (5), (23)) with the more familiar case arising from the exchange of massive propagating bosons. For the latter, <span class="math inline">\(v_{q \omega}\)</span> is inversely proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\left(q^{2}+\kappa^{2}\right)\left(\omega^{2}-s^{2} q^{2}\right),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the speed of propagation, <span class="math inline">\(\kappa^{2}\)</span> is a measure of mass and <span class="math inline">\(1 / \kappa\)</span> is the interaction range. We see from eqs. (5) and (23) that, in our problem, <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\((1 / c \chi)^{1 / 2}\)</span> and hence that the range, as already argued qualitatively, diverges at the critical point. It also follows from eqs. (5) and (23) that the frequency of propagation of the interaction is now not real but purely imaginary. Thus, by analogy, we may describe our interaction as arising from the exchange of massive bosons of imaginary energy, which become essentially massless (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\kappa \rightarrow 0\)</span> ) as the critical point is approached. It is the latter, and hence long-range, character of the induced interaction which leads in the present language (II) to the infrared anomalies and non-Fermi liquid exponents discussed above.</p><p>We also note that analogous phenomena arise in particle physics under similar circumstances when a gauge boson becomes massless. Thus, even Thomson's electron in free space interacting with the massless photons is not expected to propagate as a free particle at very long times and long distances (Karanikas et al. 1992). This infrared anomaly, that would appear only over cosmic dimensions, has been found to have related (though not entirely equivalent) counterparts in dense electron systems which may be studied under normal laboratory conditions.</p><h4 id="anisotropic-superconductivity-1">6.4 .6 Anisotropic superconductivity</h4><p>The pairing potential (23) forms the starting point for an analysis analogous to that of BCS for a superconducting instability. It is instructive to begin with the Cooper problem in which we initially drop the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> dependence of the interaction and hence solve the Schrödinger equation of two particles in a static potential. The problem is simplified by working with the Fourier components of the potential <span class="math inline">\(v_{q}\)</span> and of the pair wavefunction <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{q},\)</span> which is expressed as a product of a 'radial' part <span class="math inline">\(R_{q}\)</span> and an angular part <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\hat{q}}\)</span> where, for the isotropic limit, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{q}\)</span> is a unit vector parallel to <span class="math inline">\(q .\)</span> Note that the spins are in a triplet or singlet state depending on whether <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\hat{q}}\)</span> has odd or even parity, respectively. The effect of the finite range of <span class="math inline">\(v_{q \omega}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is then put in approximately by limiting contributions of the transition matrix element <span class="math inline">\(v_{q-q^{\prime}}\)</span> to values of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q^{\prime}\)</span> within an appropriate range about the Fermi level. We also include the effect of the Pauli principle by restricting transitions mainly to states above the Fermi surface. This leads us to a pair wavefunction and a binding energy which is always finite if the appropriate matrix element of the interaction is negative.</p><p>An extension of this Cooper problem to take account of the co-operative effect of all pairs ultimately leads us to the BCS transition temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s }\)</span>. For a representation defined by <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\hat{q}}\)</span> for which binding occurs, we then find in the weak coupling limit <span class="math display">\[T_{ s } \cong \theta \exp (-m / g \Delta m)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is a scale set by the finite frequency range of the pair interaction, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the total mass of the quasi-particles, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m\)</span> is that part of the mass which arises from the self-interaction for the potential <span class="math inline">\((23),\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> measures the effectiveness of the pair wavefunction in sampling the attractive part of the pair potential (Millis et al. 1988 ).</p><p>In terms of the angular function <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\hat{q}}\)</span> given above this critical parameter <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is defined, in the isotropic limit, as the integral of <span class="math inline">\(v_{q-q^{\prime}} \eta_{\hat{q}} \eta_{\tilde{q}^{\prime}}\)</span> over the solid angles in both variables divided by the same without the <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> functions. Also, we note that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m / m\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C / C\)</span> in leading order in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s },\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> is given by eq. (20) and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the total heat capacity of the interacting fermion system. Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is some appropriate average over the relaxation spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span></p><p>We consider first an incipient ferromagnet defined as in the preceding section for <span class="math inline">\(c&gt;0 .\)</span> Then pairing is expected to occur for the spin triplet state, the simplest representation <span class="math inline">\(\left(\eta_{\dot{q}}\right)\)</span> for which corresponds to the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> -wave state. When the correlation wave vector <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=(1 / c \chi)^{1 / 2}\)</span> is well below the characteristic Fermi wave vector <span class="math inline">\(k_{ F },\)</span> we then find that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(1 / 3\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is of the order of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \chi^{-1} k_{ F }\)</span> (Fey and Appel 1980; Levin and Valls 1983 ). As <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> increases, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> tends to fall, and vanishes as the potential becomes essentially local in space where the p-wave function has negligible weight.</p><p>It is interesting to consider the orders of magnitude for <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s }\)</span> predicted by the above model. For p-wave pairing in liquid <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3} He , m / g \Delta m\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(3 m /\left(m-m_{0}\right),\)</span> the empirical value of which is approximately <span class="math inline">\(1.5 .\)</span> Also <span class="math inline">\(\theta \sim k_{ F }^{2} \chi_{0} / m_{0} \chi\)</span> is of the order of <span class="math inline">\(0.5 K\)</span>. Thus, eq. (24) predicts a value of a few millikelvin, in order of magnitude agreement with a transition to a triplet p-wave superfluid state observed at approximately <span class="math inline">\(2 mK\)</span></p><p>Let us now turn to the analogue of this superfluid state in metals, in which the carriers move in a lattice and are charged rather than neutral. If the expressions for <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He carry over, then for the same <span class="math inline">\(\chi / \chi_{0}\)</span> we might expect <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s }\)</span> to be greater by a factor of the order of the ratio of the nuclear to the relevant electron mass, i.e. by perhaps three orders of magnitude. Examples of p-wave superconductivity of this simple kind have not, however, been unambiguously identified, even in the low-millikelvin regime.</p><p>It is worth listing some of the effects which arise in the lattice, but not in liquid <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3} He ,\)</span> which may account for the elusiveness of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> -wave superconductivity. The list would include (i) the non-parabolic and multi-band spectrum of real metals, (ii) lack of galilean invariance, (iii) the pair breaking effects of frozen-in disorder, (iv) the spin-orbit interaction, (v) additional low-frequency branches of the spin fluctuation spectrum, (vi) corrections to the linear response approximation and (vii) further components of the true induced interaction which we have discussed only briefly. Some of these factors could have a deleterious effect on the stability of the form of superconductivity we are considering.</p><p>As an example, consider the case of <span class="math inline">\(Pd\)</span>, for which <span class="math inline">\(\chi / \chi_{0}\)</span> is indeed comparable to <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He and for which the starting mass <span class="math inline">\(m_{0}\)</span> may be taken to be the conventional band calculated value, which is nearly three orders of magnitude below that of <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He atoms. The model used for <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He would then lead to <span class="math inline">\(T_{\text {s of the order of }}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(1 K .\)</span> But a parabolic band model provides very poor estimates of the basic parameters, in particular of <span class="math inline">\(c,\)</span> which define <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in the more general expressions above. From the known <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> and estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> from neutron scattering data, as well as from first-principle calculations of the generalised susceptibility (McMullan <span class="math inline">\(1989 ;\)</span> Dungate 1990 ), we find that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m / m\)</span> is in fact much smaller in Pd than in <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He, despite the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\chi / \chi_{0}\)</span> is virtually the same in both cases. The revised estimate of <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s }\)</span> is now in the low-or sub-millikelvin range and, because of the effects of frozen-in disorder already discussed in section <span class="math inline">\(6.2,\)</span> p-wave superconductivity may be suppressed altogether. Most candidate materials which have been considered theoretically have met with a similar fate from one or another of the effects (i)-(v) listed above. Promising cases not yet investigated experimentally are summarised in section 6.2 (see also Foulkes and Gyorffy ( 1977 ) for a discussion of p-wave pairing in a more conventional BCS model). Also, we do not rule out the possibility that more exotic forms of odd-parity super-conductivity already exist in some cases among heavy fermion f-electron systems and the low-dimensional conductors (Sigrist and Ueda 1991 ).</p><p>Finally, we consider briefly singlet pairing for an even-parity anisotropic state of an incipient anti-ferromagnet. For the simple cubic lattice discussed in the preceding sub-section, a plausible representation describes an anisotropy of a 'clover leaf' form with orthogonal positive and negative lobes along the cube axes. For this choice, the parameter <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> increases to a maximum of <span class="math inline">\(1 / 6\)</span> (for <span class="math inline">\(d=3\)</span> ), rather than <span class="math inline">\(1 / 3\)</span> for the p-wave model, as the critical point is approached (Millis et al. 1988 ). We may think of the above configuration with even parity as a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> -wave state.</p><p>The exponential factor <span class="math inline">\(m / g \Delta m\)</span> is minimised by approaching the critical point, i.e. the critical pressure <span class="math inline">\(p_{ c },\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(v_{q}\)</span> is typically large and strongly <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> dependent. Thus we might expect the peak in <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s }\)</span> to be found close to <span class="math inline">\(p_{ c }\)</span> if the magnetic transition goes continuously to zero at the critical pressure. This behaviour has recently been observed in a heavy fermion anti-ferromagnet, in which the Néel temperature can be suppressed continously with hydrostatic pressure (Grosche <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. <span class="math inline">\(1996 ;\)</span> Julian <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. <span class="math inline">\(1997 b\)</span> ).</p><p>The possible applicability of anisotropic even-parity models in other systems has already been discussed in section <span class="math inline">\(6.2 .\)</span> The development of a quantitative theory, which accounts both for the appearance of anisotropic superconductivity in some cases as well as for its absence in other materials of a similar kind, remains an outstanding unsolved problem.</p><h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2><p>I am indebted to my co-workers, in particular, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.

Such mass divergences have been observed in a variety of different contexts in charged electron systems, but they have also been observed as a second-order quantum phase transition, at the Mott localization transition which accompanies the solidification of two-dimensional liquid ${ }^{3} He $</p><h3 id="quasiparticle-scattering-amplitudes">3.4 Quasiparticle scattering amplitudes</h3><p>In preview Section we introduced the quasiparticle interactions <span class="math inline">\(f_{ p \sigma, p ^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}}\)</span> as the variation of the quasiparticle energy <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ p \sigma}\)</span> with respect to changes in the quasiparticle occupancy <span class="math inline">\(\delta n_{ p ^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}}\)</span> under the condition that the rest of the Fermi sea stays in its ground state: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}f_{ p \sigma, p ^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}}&amp;=\left.\frac{\delta \epsilon_{ p \sigma}}{\delta n_{ p ^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}}}\right|_{n_{ p ^{\prime \prime} \sigma^{\prime \prime}}}\\&amp;=\frac{1}{ N ^{*}(0)}\left[F^{s}\left(\hat{ p } \cdot \hat{ p }^{\prime}\right)+\sigma \sigma^{\prime} F^{a}\left(\hat{ p } \cdot \hat{ p }^{\prime}\right)\right]\end{aligned}\]</span> The quantity <span class="math inline">\(f_{ p \sigma, p ^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}}\)</span> can be regarded as a bare forward scattering amplitude between the quasiparticles.

Zero sound is associated with collective oscillations of the Fermi surface and does not involve collisions. Whereas conventional sound travels at a speed below the Fermi velocity, zero sound is "supersonic," traveling at speeds in excess of the Fermi velocity. Historically, the observation of zero sound in liquid <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He clinched Landau Fermi-liquid theory, firmly establishing it as a foundation of fermionic many-body physics.</p><p>Let us now contrast zero sound and "first sound." Conventional sound is associated with oscillations in the density of a fluid, and hydrodynamics tells us that <span class="math display">\[u_{1}^{2}=\frac{\kappa}{\rho}=\frac{\kappa}{m n}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\rho=m n\)</span> is the density of the fluid and <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=-V \frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\)</span> is the bulk modulus. From our previous discussion, <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=\frac{n^{2}}{\chi_{c}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{c}= N ^{*}(0) /\left(1+F_{0}^{s}\right),\)</span> so the velocity of first sound in a Fermi liquid is given by <span class="math display">\[u_{1}^{2}=\frac{n}{m \chi_{c}}=\frac{n}{m N ^{*}(0)}\left(1+F_{0}^{s}\right)\]</span> Replacing <span class="math inline">\(n=\frac{p_{F}^{2}}{3 \pi^{2}}, N ^{*}(0)=\frac{m^{*} p_{F}}{\pi^{2}},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m=m^{*} /\left(1+F_{1}^{s}\right)\)</span> we obtain <span class="math display">\[u_{1}^{2}=\frac{v_{F}^{2}}{3}\left(1+F_{0}^{s}\right)\left(1+F_{1}^{s}\right)\]</span> In the non-interacting limit, <span class="math inline">\(u_{1}=v_{F} / \sqrt{3}\)</span> is smaller than the Fermi velocity.

In the high-frequency limit, <span class="math inline">\(\omega \tau&gt;&gt;1,\)</span> the collision terms can then be neglected, leading to the collisionless Boltzmann equation: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial n_{ p \sigma}}{\partial t}+\nabla_{ p } \epsilon_{ p } \cdot \nabla_{ x } n_{ p \sigma}-\nabla_{ x } \epsilon_{ p \sigma} \cdot \nabla_{ p } n_{ p \sigma}=0\]</span> For small periodic oscillations in the Fermi surface, the first two terms can be written <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial n_{ p \sigma}}{\partial t}+\nabla_{ p } \epsilon_{ p } \cdot \nabla_{ x } n_{ p \sigma}=-i\left(\omega- v _{F} \cdot q \right) \alpha_{ p \sigma} e^{i q \cdot x -i \omega t}\]</span> the last term, the position dependence of the quasiparticle energies derives from interactions <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\nabla_{x} \epsilon_{ p \sigma} &amp;=\sum_{\sigma^{\prime}} \int_{ p ^{\prime}} f_{ p \sigma, p ^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}} \nabla_{x} n_{ p ^{\prime}, \sigma^{\prime}} \\&amp;=i q e^{i q \cdot x -i \omega t} \sum_{\sigma^{\prime}} \int_{ p ^{\prime}} f_{ p \sigma, p ^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}} \alpha_{ p ^{\prime}, \sigma^{\prime}}\end{aligned}\]</span> Replacing <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{ p } n_{ p \sigma}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial \epsilon} v _{F},\)</span> the collisionless Boltzmann equation becomes <span class="math display">\[\left(\omega- v _{F} \cdot q \right) \alpha_{ p \sigma}+v_{F} \cdot q \left(-\frac{d f}{d \epsilon}\right) \sum_{\sigma^{\prime}} \int_{ p ^{\prime}} f_{ p \sigma, p ^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}} \alpha_{ p ^{\prime}, \sigma^{\prime}}=0\]</span> For a mode propagating at speed <span class="math inline">\(u , \omega=u q .\)</span> If we express <span class="math inline">\(v _{F} \cdot q =v_{F} q \cos \theta_{ p },\)</span> and write the mode velocity as a factor <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> times the Fermi velocity, <span class="math inline">\(u=s v_{F},\)</span> then this becomes <span class="math display">\[\left(s-\cos \theta_{ p }\right) \alpha_{ p \sigma}+\cos \theta_{ p }\left(-\frac{d f}{d \epsilon}\right) \sum_{\sigma^{\prime}} \int_{ p ^{\prime}} f_{ p \sigma, p ^{\prime} \sigma^{\prime}} \alpha_{ p ^{\prime}, \sigma^{\prime}}=0\]</span> We see that the fluctuations in occupancy associated with a zero sound mode, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{ p \sigma}=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\sigma}(\hat{ p })\left(-\frac{d f}{d \epsilon}\right),\)</span> are proportional to the energy derivative of the Fermi function, and thus confined to within an energy scale <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> of the Fermi surface.

id="representation-theory-表示论">Representation Theory 表示论</h2><blockquote><p>群论可以描述变换本身而<strong>不必联系</strong>现实中的特定对象，这是群论的重要特征。</p></blockquote><p>理论上经常从抽象观点来考虑一个群。这意味着用流形结构与群乘法定义群。例如 <span class="math inline">\(S U (2)\)</span> 就是 <span class="math inline">\(S^{3}(\)</span> 超球面)，群元就是流形中 的点，群乘法规定两个群元 <span class="math inline">\(a, b\)</span> 怎样结合，且满足群公理。搞物理 的更关心一个群到底能做什么，即<strong>群作用</strong>。</p><h3 id="定义">定义</h3><p>同一个群能<strong>作用于</strong>许多不同种类的东西，这一重要事实使我们定义了<strong>表示</strong>的概念:</p><blockquote><p>群 <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> 的一个表示就是从 <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> 到某个向量空间 <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> 上全体线性变换组成的集合的映射，将表示记作 R, 映射 <span class="math display">\[R:  {g}  \mapsto R(g)\]</span> 其中 <span class="math

id="相似变换">相似变换</h4><p>首先是相似变换。给定任意矩阵 <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> 与可逆矩阵 <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>。则通过可逆矩阵进行相似变换得到: <span class="math display">\[R \rightarrow R^{\prime}=S^{-1} R S\]</span> 相似变换与表示的关系在于</p><ul><li>给定群 <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span></li><li>群的表示 <span class="math inline">\(R(G)\)</span></li><li>任意可逆矩阵 <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span></li></ul><p>则 <span class="math inline">\(S^{-1} R S\)</span> 也是群表示。</p><p>这可以从群的定义直接看出来: <span class="math inline">\(\forall g_{1}, g_{2} \in G,\)</span> 表示 <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> 把群元映射为向量空间 <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> 上的线性变换 $R(g_{1}), R(g_{2}) $。 群的定义要求 <span class="math display">\[R\left(g_{1}\right) R\left(g_{2}\right)=R\left(g_{1} g_{2}\right)\]</span> 现在把表示进行相似变换： <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}&amp;S^{-1} R\left(g_{1}\right) {S S^{-1}}  R\left(g_{2}\right) S\\=&amp;S^{-1} R\left(g_{1}\right) R\left(g_{2}\right) S\\=&amp;S^{-1} R\left(g_{1} g_{2}\right) S\end{aligned}\]</span> 上式可得 <span class="math inline">\(S^{-1} R S\)</span> 也是一个表示。如果我们有一个表示，那么就能利用任意可逆矩阵变出好多其他表示，新表示的形式可以更漂亮（比如让它是对角矩阵）。</p><h4 id="不变子空间">不变子空间</h4><p>给定群 <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> 在向量空间 <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> 上的表示 <span class="math inline">\(R,\)</span> 如果 <span class="math inline">\(V^{\prime} \subset V\)</span> 满足 <span class="math display">\[\forall v \in V^{\prime}, g \in G, \text { 都有 } R(g) v \in V^{\prime}\]</span> 则 <span class="math inline">\(V^{\prime}\)</span> 称为 <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>的<strong>不变子空间</strong>。</p><p>任意群元作用于 <span class="math inline">\(V^{\prime}\)</span> 中的任意向量所得向量仍然在 <span class="math inline">\(V^{\prime}\)</span> 内，这就可以在 <span class="math inline">\(V^{\prime}\)</span> 上定义群 <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> 的表示 <span class="math inline">\(R^{\prime}\)</span> 了: <span class="math display">\[R^{\prime}(g) v=R(g) v, \quad \forall v \in V^{\prime}, g \in G\]</span> 这种情况下，表示 <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> 就有一种不够基本的感觉，它更像是多个小基本部件所构成的。我们称原来的表示 <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> 不是原来的向量空间 V的基本表示，<span class="math inline">\(R^{\prime}\)</span> 称为<strong>子表示</strong>。</p><h4 id="不可约表示">不可约表示</h4><p>定义了上述概念之后就能引入超级重要的<strong>不可约表示</strong>。</p><blockquote><p>群 <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>在向量空间 <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> 上的不可约表示 <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> 意味着除了 0 空间和 <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> 自身之外再无不变子空间。不可约表示是<strong>基本的</strong>，它们<strong>不能再分解</strong>为子表示。利用所有的不可约表示可导出其他所有表示。</p></blockquote><p>还可以从<strong>另一个角度</strong>看不可约表示: 不可约表示不能通过<strong>相似变换</strong>变成分块对角矩阵形式。而可约表示能被相似变换变成分块对角形式。表示的可约性很关键，比如描述基本粒子要用不可约表示，基本粒子在变换下的行为由相应对称群的不可约表示描述。</p><h3 id="casimir-元">Casimir 元</h3><blockquote><p>一个群有许多表示，怎么知道哪个是描述自然的基本表示？</p></blockquote><p>Casimir 元可以给我们答案。Casimir 元（记作 <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>）从 Lie 代数的元素 一生成元导出，它的定义是，对任意生成元 X 都有 <span class="math display">\[[C, X]=0\]</span> 著名的 Schur 引理告诉我们</p><blockquote><p>给定一个不可约群表示 <span class="math inline">\(R: g \rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(G L(V),\)</span> 如果某个线性变换 <span class="math inline">\(T: V \rightarrow V(\)</span> 即 <span class="math inline">\(T \in G L(V))\)</span> 与所有<span class="math inline">\(R(g), \forall g \in G\)</span> 对易 ， 则 <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> 必为恒等变换的常数倍。</p></blockquote><p>因此 Casimir元是群表示的<strong>“常数”</strong>，这些“常数”的值自然地为群表示“编号”。之后我们就从 Casimir 元对应编号最低的不可约表示开始。</p><p>群表示的定义与向量空间 V 有关。</p><blockquote><p><strong>一个表示就是将抽象群到 V 的线性变换的映射。</strong></p></blockquote><p>线性代数告诉我们以任意矩阵的本征向量为基可以张成一个向量空间。任意 Lie 群的生成元至少有一个可以通过相似变成对角矩阵，然后这个对角生成元的本征向量就可作为向量空间的基。</p><p>下一节导出 <span class="math inline">\(S U (2)\)</span> 群的不可约表示。研究 <span class="math inline">\(S U (2)\)</span> 是因为Lorentz 群的 Lie 代数是两份 <span class="math inline">\(S U (2)\)</span> 的 Lie 代数。Lorentz 群是Poincaré 群的一部分，本章由浅入深对他们逐一讨论。</p>]]></content>

我们就有了一个完整的理论.</p><p>然而，在做这样的尝试之前, 我们需要考察 各个模型的优点。在这个考察的过程中, 我们将引出一些基本的想法。 微观模型的判据并不是固定的, 它依赖于所感兴趣的现象。这一点在下面能够 导出临界现象的模型序列中演示。为了具体起见, 我们将讨论限制在给定的晶 体中的铁磁临界现象。</p><h4 id="模型1-万有模型">模型(1): 万有模型</h4><blockquote><p>模型(1)：由库仑力相互作用的电子和原子核。</p></blockquote><p>这肯定是能够导出几乎所有现象, 包括临界现象的微观模型。但作为研究临 界现象的出发点, 这个模型显然是不切实际的。</p><h4 id="模型-2-晶格模型">模型 (2): 晶格模型</h4><blockquote><p>模型 (2): 在一个指定晶格内的具有有效相互作用的电子。</p></blockquote><p>现在, 我们假定晶格结构为已知的, 并且理所当然地认为指定电子-电子相互作用. 能带结构、晶体场等的参数已经由原子物理和固体物理学家基于模型得到。</p><p>这个模型比模型(1) 更适合分析临界现象, 这是由于晶格结构的形成和原子 的内层电子离开临界现象太远. 我们期望这些已经是给定的。</p><p>由于临界现象是电子自旋在大尺度上的集体行为, 除了对于电子自旋之间相 互作用的总体贡献外, 我们或许不需要知道能带结构以及许多细节。这个模型还 可以进一步简化。</p><h4 id="模型3-自旋模型">模型(3): 自旋模型</h4><blockquote><p>模型 (3): 在给定的晶格的每个原胞中放置一个经典自旋, 并指明 自旋之间的 相互作用.</p></blockquote><p>这里, 量子本质、电子运动以及许多模型 (2) 的细节都忽略了。自旋-自旋相 互作用由若干参数指定, 通过使得尽可能模拟模型 (2) 的结论来调整这些参数的值. 这种模拟是非平庸的 , 这些模型中最常用的一些版本, 如伊辛模型和海森伯模型 (会在后面定义这些模型) 是非常粗橙的。然而, 我 们认为重要的物理<strong>在于</strong> <strong>大量</strong>的电子自旋<strong>一起</strong>表现出来的行为。因此在单个原胞上有点粗粒超无关紧要. 这个模型对临界现象而言与模型 (1) 和模型 (2) 同样微观。</p><h4 id="模型-4-块自旋模型">模型 (4): 块自旋模型</h4><blockquote><p>模型 (4): 在每个由 <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2 \times 2\)</span> 个原胞构成的块上放置一个经典自旋, 并指明 自旋 之间的相互作用。</p></blockquote><p>这在消去细节上比模型(3) 又前进了一步. 这里的每个“自旋”是模型(3) 的8 个自旋的网格。同样, 如果只涉及大尺度的行为, 除了总体效应外, 我们不在意 每个块的细节以及块上自旋之间的相互作用。这个模型显然不比模型 (3) 不微观.</p><h4 id="模型5-更大块上的自旋">模型(5): 更大块上的自旋。</h4><p>代替 <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2 \times 2\)</span> 的块, 我们可以取 <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 3 \times 3\)</span> 甚至 <span class="math inline">\(10 \times 10 \times 10\)</span> 的块. 在构成更 大的块上我们能够走多远, 同时还能声称是微观模型？这里没有清楚的答案。但 定性而言, 答案是块的尺寸必须远小于临界现象的特征尺寸，即第 1 章讲过的自 旋斑块的平均尺寸。如果我们认为这些自旋斑块在 <span class="math inline">\(T_{ }\)</span> 接近于 <span class="math inline">\(T_{\mathrm{c}}\)</span> 时不断变大, 那么块的尺寸在 T 非常接近于 <span class="math inline">\(T_{\mathrm{c}}\)</span> 时可以取得非常大. 块的构造的想法和应用是由Kadanoff (1966,1967) 给出的。</p><h4 id="模型的选择">模型的选择</h4><p>在上述的模型序列中, 那些我们认为与临界现象无关的细节被逐步消除。当 完成这样的消除过程时, 为了避免巨大的数学上的复杂性, 简化是一个实际上的必要手段。</p><p>通常，模型中的参数由实验数据来确定，因为计算是不实际的。无需指明的是, 例如模型 (1) 中的电子电荷就是由实验确定的. 模型 (2) 中的晶格结构可以用 X 射线散射确定. 对于模型 (3) (5), 我们可以通过拟合在温度不太靠近 <span class="math inline">\(T_{\mathrm{c}}\)</span> 处的 实验数据来定出参数。</p><p>传统上, 临界现象的大多数理论研究始于模型 (3) 的不同版本。我们将主要 考察模型 (5). 金兹堡-朗道模型可以认为是模型 (5) 的一个粗彭版本. 当然, 先介 绍模型 (3) 并演示如何由此推出模型 (4) 和模型 (5) 的方式, 具有示范意义。这就 是本章所用的方式。</p><h3 id="原胞哈密顿的经典模型">2.2 原胞哈密顿的经典模型</h3><h4 id="伊辛模型">2.2.1 伊辛模型</h4><p>每个原胞内有一个自旋变量 <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{c},\)</span>

\sigma_{3 c}\right)\]</span> 则 <span class="math inline">\(\hat{H}[\sigma]=\frac{1}{2} J \sum_{c} \sum_{r}^{\prime}\left(\sigma_{c}-\sigma_{c+r}\right)^{2}\)</span> 就变为海森伯模型的原胞哈密顿. 它模拟各向同性的铁磁体。注意我们把

从而块自旋间的相互作用依赖于有限个, 即约 <span class="math inline">\(b^{d}\)</span> 个, 位于几个块中的原胞 自旋的行为. 我们曾经指出有限个原胞自旋不可能导致奇异行为. 从而块哈密顿 是 T 以及原胞哈密顿的其他参数的光滑函数. 我们在本章的开头演示了模型 (3)(原胞哈密顿) 与模型 (4) 和 (5)(块哈密顿) 之间的关系. 为了得到任意一个从模型 (4) 到 (5)、从模型(3) 到 (4)、从模型 (2) 到 (3) 以及从模型 (1) 到(2) 的明确计算都是非常困难的, 必须做合适的近似. 些明确的计算将在讨论重正化群时给出.</p><h3 id="金兹堡-朗道形式">2.5 金兹堡-朗道形式</h3><p>金兹堡-朗道 (Ginzburg-Landau) 理论在超导理论及其他临界现象中起到了 重要的作用.

/ T)\)</span> 将发散.</p><p>当式 <span class="math inline">\(U\left( \sigma _{ x }\right)=a_{0}+a_{2} \sigma_{x}^{2}+a_{4} \sigma _{ x }^{4}\)</span> 中包含梯度项 <span class="math inline">\(\left( \sigma _{ x }- \sigma _{ x +y}\right)^{2}\)</span> 时, 块自旋将不再相互独立. 于是,金兹堡-朗道形式以这个简单的梯度项来描述相邻块之间的相互作用. 对于铁磁 体, 我们期望这个相互作用使得块自旋倾向于与其近邻块的自旋平行。梯度项描 述这一倾向, 其强度由系数 c 确定. 这一项只有在所有的块自旋具有相同值时才 为零. 块自旋之间的差别越大, H/T 越大, 从而概率越小. 我们认为块自旋之间的 相互作用并不是完全由梯度项决定的, 应该还有相邻自旋相乘的高阶项. 总而言之, 金兹堡-朗道形式的块哈密顿是最简单但不是最一般的形式. 最一 般的形式应该包括所有的块自旋乘积的景次. 金兹堡-朗道形式只保留了最低阶 项. 当然, 这个形式可以通过把 <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x}^{4}\)</span> 的项丢掉而简化. 但是, 这 是一个过分的简化. 注意我们在块哈密顿中排除了分数景和其他形式的 <span class="math inline">\(\sigma _{ x }\)</span> 的奇异函数. 排除的 理由在于我们假定自旋之间的相互作用是短程的, 从而块自旋中的项描述的是约 <span class="math inline">\(b^{d}\)</span> 个自旋的“局部性质”, 因此必须是 <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{ x }, h\)</span> 和 <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> 的光滑函数.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>参考</p><ul><li>《Fundamentals of Many-body》 Wolfgang Nolting Theoretical Physics 9</li></ul><h2 id="the-quasi-particle-concept">The Quasi-particle Concept</h2><p>In Sect. <span class="math inline">\(3.3,\)</span> we discussed relatively simple, exactly solvable model systems, which strictly speaking do not require the Green's function formalism. They were intended merely to introduce the solution techniques. The full scope of the method becomes clear only when it is applied to the treatment of interacting systems. In most such cases, to be sure, we will then no longer be able to treat the many-body problem in a mathematically strict manner. Approximations are unavoidable and must be tolerated. The concept of <span class="math display">\[quasi-particles\]</span> has proven to be extraordinarily useful in this connection, and we shall consider it in detail in the present section. To be more concrete, we will first keep interacting electron systems in mind. The extension to other many-body systems will cause no difficulties.</p><p>We wish to investigate which statements about interacting electron systems can be made using Green's functions. To this end, we must first define the operators (or combinations of operators) <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> which are to be used to construct the Green's function being considered. In most practical cases, the type of this function is quite unambiguously fixed by the physical problem and by the representation of the model Hamiltonian used.</p><h3 id="one-electron-greens-functions">One-Electron Green's Functions</h3><p>As in <span class="math inline">\((2.55),\)</span> the Hamiltonian of a system of <span class="math inline">\(N_{ e }\)</span> mutually-interacting electrons in the Bloch representation is given by: <span class="math display">\[H=\sum_{k \sigma} \varepsilon(k) a_{k \sigma}^{+} a_{k \sigma}+\frac{1}{2} \sum_{k p q \atop \sigma \sigma^{\prime}} v_{k p}(q) a_{k+q \sigma}^{+} a_{p-q \sigma^{\prime}}^{+} a_{p \sigma^{\prime}} a_{k \sigma}\]</span> We limit our considerations to the electrons of a single energy band, so that we can suppress the band indices. For the so-called Bloch energies <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon(k),\)</span> from (2.14) and (2.21) we have: <span class="math display">\[\varepsilon( k )=\int d ^{3} r \psi_{k}^{*}( r )\left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \Delta+V( r )\right] \psi_{k}( r )\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{k}( r )\)</span> is a Bloch function and <span class="math inline">\(V( r )\)</span> is the periodic lattice potential. We treat <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon( k )\)</span> in the following as a given model parameter. We calculated the Coulomb matrix element in (2.54): <span class="math display">\[v_{k p}(q)=\frac{e^{2}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \iint d ^{3} r_{1} d ^{3} r_{2} \frac{\psi_{k+q}^{*}\left( r _{1}\right) \psi_{p-q}^{*}\left( r _{2}\right) \psi_{p}\left( r _{2}\right) \psi_{k}\left( r _{1}\right)}{\left| r _{1}- r _{2}\right|}\]</span> With a constant lattice potential <span class="math inline">\(V( r ) \equiv\)</span> const, this becomes <span class="math display">\[v_{k p}(q) \frac{e^{2}}{V(r)= const } v_{0}(q)=\frac{e^{2}}{\varepsilon_{0} V q^{2}}\]</span> Frequently, one uses the model Hamiltonian (3.311) also in its Wannier representation (cf. e.g. (2.115)): <span class="math display">\[H=\sum_{i j \sigma} T_{i j} a_{i \sigma}^{+} a_{j \sigma}+\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i j k l \atop \sigma \sigma^{\prime}} v(i j ; k l) a_{i \sigma}^{+} a_{j \sigma^{\prime}}^{+} a_{l \sigma^{\prime}} a_{k \sigma}\]</span> The so-called hopping integrals <span class="math display">\[T_{i j}=\int d ^{3} r \omega^{*}\left( r - R _{i}\right)\left\{-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \Delta+V( r )\right\} \omega\left( r - R _{j}\right)\]</span> are related to the Bloch energies via a Fourier transform <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon(k)\)</span> (cf. (2.113)). <span class="math inline">\(\omega\left( r - R _{i}\right)\)</span> is the Wannier function centered at <span class="math inline">\(R_{i}\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}v(i j ; k l)=&amp; \frac{e^{2}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \iint d ^{3} r_{1} d ^{3} r_{2} \omega^{*}\left( r _{1}- R _{i}\right) \omega^{*}\left( r _{2}- R _{j}\right) \\&amp; \cdot \frac{1}{\left| r _{1}- r _{2}\right|} \omega\left( r _{2}- R _{l}\right) \omega\left( r _{1}- R _{k}\right)\end{aligned}\]</span> In this section, we show that the one-electron Green's function, already introduced in Eq. (3.193) <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}G_{k \sigma}^{\alpha}(E) \equiv &amp;\left\langle\left\langle a_{k \sigma} ; a_{k \sigma}^{+}\right\rangle\right\rangle_{E}^{\alpha} \\G_{i j \sigma}^{\alpha}(E) \equiv &amp;\left\langle\left\langle a_{i \sigma} ; a_{j \sigma}^{+}\right\rangle\right\rangle_{E}^{\alpha} \\&amp; \alpha=\text { ret, } adv , c \quad(\varepsilon=-)\end{aligned}\]</span> or the equivalent one-electron spectral density <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l}S_{k \sigma}(E)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} d \left(t-t^{\prime}\right) \exp \left(-\frac{ i }{\hbar} E\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\right)\left\langle\left[a_{k \sigma}(t), a_{k \sigma}^{+}\left(t^{\prime}\right)\right]_{+}\right\rangle \\S_{i j \sigma}(E)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} d \left(t-t^{\prime}\right) \exp \left(-\frac{ i }{\hbar} E\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\right)\left\langle\left[a_{i \sigma}(t), a_{j \sigma}^{+}\left(t^{\prime}\right)\right]_{+}\right\rangle\end{array}\]</span> determine the entire equilibrium thermodynamics, even for systems of interacting electrons. This of course presumes that one was able in some manner to compute these functions.</p><p>To show this, we first write the equation of motion of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -dependent Green's function, for which we require the following commutator: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\left[a_{k \sigma}, H \right]_{-}=&amp;(\varepsilon( k )-\mu) a_{k \sigma}+\\&amp;+\sum_{p, q \atop \sigma^{\prime}} v_{p, k+q}( q ) a_{p+q \sigma^{\prime}}^{+} a_{p \sigma^{\prime}} a_{k+q \sigma}\end{aligned}\]</span> (Its derivation can be carried out by the reader as an exercise!). With the higherorder Green's function <span class="math display">\[{ }^{\alpha} \Gamma_{p k ; q}^{\sigma^{\prime} \sigma}(E) \equiv\left\langle\left\langle a_{p+q \sigma^{\prime}}^{+} a_{p \sigma^{\prime}} a_{k+q \sigma} ; a_{k \sigma}^{+}\right\rangle\right\rangle_{E}^{\alpha}\]</span> the equation of motion is then given by: <span class="math display">\[(E-\varepsilon(k)+\mu) G_{k \sigma}^{\alpha}(E)=\hbar+\sum_{p, q, \sigma^{\prime}} v_{p, k+q}(q)^{\alpha} \Gamma_{p k ; q}^{\sigma^{\prime} \sigma}(E)\]</span> The unknown function <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> on the right-hand side prevents a direct solution of this equation. However, we postulate that the following decomposition is permitted: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\left\langle\left\langle\left[a_{k \sigma}, H - H _{0}\right]_{-} ; a_{k \sigma}^{+}\right\rangle\right\rangle_{E}^{\alpha} &amp;=\sum_{p, q, \sigma^{\prime}} v_{p, k+q}(q) \Gamma_{p k ; q}^{\sigma^{\prime} \sigma}(E) \equiv \\&amp; \equiv \Sigma_{\sigma}^{\alpha}(k, E) G_{k \sigma}^{\alpha}(E)\end{aligned}\]</span> This equation defines the so-called <span class="math display">\[\text { self-energy, } \quad \Sigma_{\sigma}^{\alpha}(k, E)\]</span> which we wish to discuss in more detail. With it, the equation of motion (3.324) can be formally solved in a simple fashion: <span class="math display">\[G_{k \sigma}^{\alpha}(E)=\frac{\hbar}{E-\left(\varepsilon(k)-\mu+\Sigma_{\sigma}^{\alpha}(k, E)\right)}\]</span> Comparing this expression with that for the non-interacting system <span class="math inline">\((3.197),\)</span> we see that the entire influence of the particle interactions is contained in the self-energy <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{\sigma}(k, E) .\)</span> As a rule, this is a complex-valued function of <span class="math inline">\((k, E),\)</span> whose real part determines the energy and whose imaginary part the lifetime of the quasi-particles, which we have yet to define.</p><p>We can reformulate Eq. (3.326) to some extent. We denote the one-electron Green's function of the non-interacting electrons by <span class="math inline">\(G_{k c}^{(0)}(E) ;\)</span> then from (3.326) it follows that: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}G_{k \sigma}(E)=\hbar\left\{\hbar\left[G_{k \sigma}^{(0)}(E)\right]^{-1}-\Sigma_{\sigma}(k, E)\right\}^{-1} \\\Longrightarrow\left\{\left[G_{k \sigma}^{(0)}(E)\right]^{-1}-\frac{1}{\hbar} \Sigma_{\sigma}(k, E)\right\} G_{k \sigma}(E)=1\end{aligned}\]</span> Here, we have suppressed the index <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to make the expressions clearer. Finally, we arrive at the so-called</p><blockquote><p>Dyson equation <span class="math display">\[G_{k \sigma}(E)=G_{k \sigma}^{(0)}(E)+\frac{1}{\hbar} G_{k \sigma}^{(0)}(E) \Sigma_{\sigma}(k, E) G_{k \sigma}(E)\]</span></p></blockquote><p>Our goal will be to obtain at least an approximate determination of the self-energy. Inserting an approximate expression for <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_{\sigma}(k, E)\)</span> into the Dyson equation already implies summation over an infinite partial series. We recall however that for the derivation of <span class="math inline">\((3.327),\)</span> we had to postulate the decomposition (3.325) of the higherorder Green's function.</p><h3 id="the-electronic-self-energy">The Electronic Self-Energy</h3><p>In this section, we wish to obtain an overview of the general structures of the fundamental quantities self-energy, Green's functions, and spectral density. Our starting point is the representation (3.326) of the single-particle Green's function, whereby in the case of the self-energy, we are dealing in general with a complex quantity: <span class="math display">\[\Sigma_{\sigma}^{\alpha}(k, E)=R_{\sigma}^{\alpha}(k, E)+ i I_{\sigma}^{\alpha}(k, E)\]</span> The index <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> stands for retarded, advanced, or causal. The corresponding selfenergies are quite distinct. Thus, for example, according to (3.186) and (3.187) for a real spectral density, we have: <span class="math display">\[\left(G_{k \sigma}^{ adv }(E)\right)^{*}=G_{k \sigma}^{ ret }(E)\]</span> This implies <span class="math display">\[\left(\Sigma_{\sigma}^{ adv }(k, E)\right)^{*}=\Sigma_{\sigma}^{ ret }(k, E)\]</span> The relationship is thus simple. We may limit our considerations without loss of generality to the retarded functions. We then leave off the supplement <span class="math inline">\(+ i 0^{+},\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(I_{\sigma} \neq\)</span> 0. We omit the index "ret" on the self-energy in the following. First, we rearrange Eq. (3.326) slightly: <span class="math display">\[G_{k \sigma}^{ ret }(E)=\hbar \frac{\left\{E-\left(\varepsilon(k)-\mu+R_{\sigma}(k, E)\right)\right\}+ i I_{\sigma}(k, E)}{\left\{E-\left(\varepsilon(k)-\mu+R_{\sigma}(k, E)\right)\right\}^{2}+I_{\sigma}^{2}(k, E)}\]</span> From (3.154), we then have for the spectral density: <span class="math display">\[S_{k \sigma}(E)=-\frac{\hbar}{\pi} \frac{I_{\sigma}(k, E)}{\left\{E-\left(\varepsilon(k)-\mu+R_{\sigma}(k, E)\right)\right\}^{2}+I_{\sigma}^{2}(k, E)}\]</span> With (3.146), we could have given the general spectral representation of the spectral density, which - for the case of the one-electron spectral density which interests us here-becomes: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}S_{k \sigma}(E)=&amp; \frac{\hbar}{\Xi} \sum_{n, m}\left|\left\langle E_{n}\left|a_{k \sigma}^{+}\right| E_{m}\right\rangle\right|^{2} e ^{-\beta E_{n}}\left( e ^{\beta E}+1\right) \\&amp; \cdot \delta\left[E-\left(E_{n}-E_{m}\right)\right]\end{aligned}\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(S_{k \sigma}(E)\)</span> is thus non-negative for all <span class="math inline">\((k, \sigma, E)\)</span>. This, however, according to (3.331), gives <span class="math display">\[I_{\sigma}(k, E) \leq 0\]</span> for the imaginary part of the self-energy (retarded!). We now want to investigate the expression (3.331) somewhat more precisely. Without explicit knowledge of <span class="math inline">\(R_{\sigma}(k, E)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I_{\sigma}(k, E),\)</span> we nevertheless expect in the usual case to find more or less prominent maxima in the spectral density at the resonance energies <span class="math inline">\(E_{i \sigma}(k)\)</span> defined by <span class="math display">\[E_{i \sigma}(k) \stackrel{!}{=} \varepsilon(k)-\mu+R_{\sigma}\left(k, E_{i \sigma}(k)\right) ; \quad i=1,2,3, \ldots\]</span> Here, we must distinguish between two cases. Case A: Let <span class="math display">\[I_{\sigma}(k, E) \equiv 0\]</span> hold in a certain energy range, which contains the resonance <span class="math inline">\(E_{i \sigma} .\)</span> Then, in <span class="math inline">\((3.331),\)</span> we must go to the limit <span class="math inline">\(I_{\sigma} \rightarrow-0^{+} .\)</span> Using the formulation of the <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> -function as a limiting expression, <span class="math display">\[\delta\left(E-E_{0}\right)=\frac{1}{\pi} \lim _{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{x}{\left(E-E_{0}\right)^{2}+x^{2}}\]</span> we then find: <span class="math display">\[S_{k \sigma}(E)=\hbar \delta\left[E-\left(\varepsilon(k)-\mu+R_{\sigma}(k, E)\right)\right]\]</span> We then make use of <span class="math display">\[\delta[f(x)]=\sum_{i} \frac{1}{\left|f^{\prime}\left(x_{i}\right)\right|} \delta\left(x-x_{i}\right) ; \quad f\left(x_{i}\right)=0\]</span> which allows us to write the following expression in place of (3.337) : <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l}S_{k \sigma}(E)=\hbar \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_{i \sigma}(k) \delta\left(E-E_{i \sigma}(k)\right) \\\alpha_{i \sigma}(k)=\left|1-\frac{\partial}{\partial E} R_{\sigma}(k, E)\right|_{E=E_{i \sigma}}^{-1}\end{array}\]</span> The sums extend over those resonances <span class="math inline">\(E_{i \sigma}\)</span> which lie within the energy range where (3.335) is valid.</p><p>Case B: We assume <span class="math display">\[I_{\sigma}(k, E) \neq 0\]</span> where, however, <span class="math display">\[\left|I_{\sigma}(k, E)\right| \ll\left|\varepsilon(k)-\mu+R_{\sigma}(k, E)\right|\]</span> is valid within a certain neighbourhood of the resonance <span class="math inline">\(E_{i \sigma} .\)</span> Then we can expect a prominent maximum at the energy <span class="math inline">\(E=E_{i \sigma} .\)</span> To see this, we expand the expression <span class="math display">\[F_{\sigma}(k, E) \equiv \varepsilon(k)-\mu+R_{\sigma}(k, E)\]</span> around the resonance position and terminate the series after the linear term: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}F_{\sigma}(k, E) &amp;=F_{\sigma}\left(k, E_{i \sigma}\right)+\left.\left(E-E_{i \sigma}\right) \frac{\partial F_{\sigma}}{\partial E}\right|_{E=E_{i \sigma}}+\cdots \\&amp;=E_{i \sigma}(k)+\left.\left(E-E_{i \sigma}\right) \frac{\partial R_{\sigma}}{\partial E}\right|_{E=E_{i \sigma}}+\cdots\end{aligned}\]</span> This means that: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\left(E-\varepsilon( k )+\mu-R_{\sigma}( k , E)\right)^{2} &amp; \simeq\left(E-E_{i \sigma}\right)^{2}\left(1-\left.\frac{\partial R_{\sigma}}{\partial E}\right|_{E=E_{i \sigma}}\right)^{2}=\\&amp;=\alpha_{i \sigma}^{-2}( k )\left(E-E_{i \sigma}( k )\right)^{2}\end{aligned}\]</span> We insert this expression into <span class="math inline">\((3.331) .\)</span> Let us now further assume that <span class="math inline">\(I_{\sigma}(k, E)\)</span> in the neighbourhood of the resonance <span class="math inline">\(E_{i \sigma}\)</span> is a continuous, only weakly varying function of <span class="math inline">\(E,\)</span> so that to a good approximation in the energy region of interest, we can set <span class="math display">\[I_{\sigma}(k, E) \approx I_{\sigma}\left(k, E_{i \sigma}(k)\right) \equiv I_{i \sigma}(k)\]</span> then the spectral density can be approximated as follows: <span class="math display">\[S_{k \sigma}^{(i)}(E) \approx-\frac{\hbar}{\pi} \frac{\alpha_{i \sigma}^{2}(k) I_{i \sigma}(k)}{\left(E-E_{i \sigma}(k)\right)^{2}+\left(\alpha_{i \sigma}(k) I_{i \sigma}(k)\right)^{2}}\]</span> Under the given assumptions, the spectral density has a Lorentz shape in the neighbourhood of the resonance <span class="math inline">\(E_{i \sigma}\)</span>. Note however, that for this to hold, in particular (3.342) must be fulfilled. This condition can however unfortunately be verified only after a complete solution of the problem is at hand. It thus remains speculative for the time being, but is satisfactorily confirmed by a number of examples of concrete applications. However, we shall also encounter systems for which the shape of the spectral density is found to be quite different from the Lorentz form, i.e. for which (3.342) is not obeyed (Fig. 3.4).</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210108180551921.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><blockquote><p>Fig. 3.4 The qualitative shape of the spectral density for a system of interacting Fermions</p></blockquote><p>As a rule, however, according to our preliminary considerations, the spectral density will be a linear combination of weighted Lorentz and <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> -functions.</p><p>This structure of the spectral density will lead us in the next section to the concept of the quasi-particle. In this connection, it is interesting to examine the behaviour of the time-dependent spectral density, which one sometimes calls the propagator. (Occasionally, this term is also used for the time-dependent Green's function.) In the case of a non-interacting particle system, it represents a non-damped harmonic oscillation, as one can see from Eq. <span class="math inline">\((3.207) .\)</span> This is true in the system of interacting particles only for case <span class="math inline">\(A ,\)</span> when the spectral density can be written as a <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> -function (3.337). From (3.339), it then namely follows that: <span class="math display">\[S_{k \sigma}\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_{i \sigma}(k) \exp \left(-\frac{ i }{\hbar} E_{i \sigma}(k)\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\right)\]</span> The frequencies of oscillation are then determined by the resonance energies <span class="math inline">\(E_{i \sigma}(k)\)</span></p><p>For case <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, in contrast, the Lorentz peaks require exponentially damped oscillators. To see this, we assume for the moment that (3.345) holds to a good approximation over the entire energy range. Then we can write: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}S_{k \sigma}^{(i)}\left(t-t^{\prime}\right) \approx &amp; \frac{1}{4 \pi^{2} i } \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} d E \exp \left(-\frac{ i }{\hbar} E\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\right) \alpha_{i \sigma}( k ) \\&amp;\cdot\{ \frac{1}{E-\left(E_{i \sigma}( k )- i \alpha_{i \sigma}( k ) I_{i \sigma}( k )\right)}-\\&amp;\left.-\frac{1}{E-\left(E_{i \sigma}( k )+ i \alpha_{i \sigma}( k ) I_{i \sigma}( k )\right)}\right\}\end{aligned}\]</span> We solve the integrals using the residual theorem. The spectral weights are positive definite, so that due to (3.333), we must have: <span class="math display">\[\alpha_{i \sigma}(k) I_{i \sigma}(k) \leq 0\]</span> The first term thus has a pole in the upper half-plane, and the second term has a pole in the lower half-plane. If we choose the following integration paths,</p><p><img src="https://jptanjing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210108180735063.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" /></p><p>then the exponential function in (3.347) guarantees that the semicircle which is closed at infinity makes no contribution. According to the residual theorem, for <span class="math inline">\(t-t^{\prime}&gt;0\)</span> then only the second term makes a contribution to the integral in (3.347) whilst for <span class="math inline">\(t-t^{\prime}&lt;0,\)</span> only the first term contributes. This yields finally: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}S_{k \sigma}^{(i)}\left(t-t^{\prime}\right) \approx &amp; \frac{1}{2 \pi} \alpha_{i \sigma}( k ) \exp \left(-\frac{ i }{\hbar} E_{i \sigma}( k )\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\right) \\&amp; \cdot \exp \left(-\frac{1}{\hbar}\left|\alpha_{i \sigma}( k ) I_{i \sigma}( k )\right|\left|t-t^{\prime}\right|\right)\end{aligned}\]</span> The time-dependent spectral density indeed represents a damped oscillation, whose frequency again corresponds to a resonance <span class="math inline">\(E_{i \sigma},\)</span> whilst the damping is essentially determined by the imaginary part of the self-energy.</p><p>Thus, in general for interacting systems, we can expect that <span class="math inline">\(S_{k \sigma}\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\)</span> will consist of a superposition of damped and undamped oscillations, whose frequencies correspond to the resonance energies <span class="math inline">\(E_{i \sigma}\)</span>. The resulting time dependence can then become quite complicated.</p><p>Precisely this qualitative picture of the time dependence of the spectral density will lead us in the next section to the concept of the quasi-particle, which is typical of many-body theory.</p><h3 id="quasi-particles">Quasi-particles</h3><p>In this section, we will draw some preliminary conclusions. What is in fact the <span class="math inline">\(n e w\)</span> aspect of the Green's function formalism as compared to conventional methods? What do Green's functions or spectral densities have to do with quasi-particles? What are quasi-particles after all? We presume that they are related to the more or less prominent resonance peaks in the spectral density which we discussed in the last section. We want to clarify this point qualitatively by considering a special case <span class="math display">\[T=0 ; \quad|k|&gt;k_{ F } ; \quad t&gt;t^{\prime}\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(k_{ F }\)</span> denotes the Fermi wavevector. We presume the system to be in its ground state <span class="math inline">\(\left|E_{0}\right\rangle .\)</span> Upon adding a <span class="math inline">\(( k , \sigma)\)</span> electron at the time <span class="math inline">\(t,\)</span> the state <span class="math display">\[\left|\varphi_{0}(t)\right\rangle=a_{k \sigma}^{+}(t)\left|E_{0}\right\rangle\]</span> is created, which must not necessarily be an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Owing to <span class="math inline">\(| k |&gt;k_{ F },\)</span> only one of the two terms in the definition of the propagator (3.127) <span class="math inline">\(S_{k \sigma}\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\)</span> can contribute. We therefore have <span class="math display">\[2 \pi S_{k \sigma}\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)=\left\langle\varphi_{0}(t) \mid \varphi_{0}\left(t^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle\]</span> With this, the time-dependent spectral density acquires a clear interpretation. <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi S_{k \sigma}\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\)</span> is the probability amplitude that the state <span class="math inline">\(\left|\varphi_{0}\right\rangle,\)</span> which was formed from the ground state <span class="math inline">\(\left|E_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> by adding a <span class="math inline">\((k, \sigma)\)</span> electron at the time <span class="math inline">\(t^{\prime},\)</span> still exists at a time <span class="math inline">\(t&gt;t^{\prime} . S_{k \sigma}\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\)</span> thus characterises the time evolution (propagation)</p><p>of an additional <span class="math inline">\(( k , \sigma)\)</span> electron in the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> -particle system. If we had presupposed <span class="math inline">\(|k|&lt;k_{ F },\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(S_{k \sigma}\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\)</span> would describe the propagation of a hole. We must now distinguish between two typical cases: <span class="math display">\[\left|\left\langle\varphi_{0}(t) \mid \varphi_{0}\left(t^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle\right|^{2}=\text { const } \Longleftrightarrow \text { stationary state }\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\left|\left\langle\varphi_{0}(t) \mid \varphi_{0}\left(t^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle\right|^{2} \underset{t-t^{\prime} \rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow} 0 \Longleftrightarrow \text { state with a finite lifetime. }\]</span></p><p>First, we again consider</p><h5 id="non-interacting-electrons">(1) Non-interacting electrons</h5><p>described by <span class="math display">\[H _{0}=\sum_{k, \sigma}(\varepsilon( k )-\mu) a_{k \sigma}^{+} a_{k \sigma}\]</span> One readily obtains <span class="math display">\[\left[ H _{0}, a_{k \sigma}^{+}\right]_{-}=(\varepsilon( k )-\mu) a_{k \sigma}^{+}\]</span> with which we find <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}H _{0}\left(a_{k \sigma}^{+}\left|E_{0}\right\rangle\right) &amp;=a_{k \sigma}^{+} H _{0}\left|E_{0}\right\rangle+\left[ H _{0}, a_{k \sigma}^{+}\right]_{-}\left|E_{0}\right\rangle=\\&amp;=\left(E_{0}+\varepsilon( k )-\mu\right)\left(a_{k \sigma}^{+}\left|E_{0}\right\rangle\right)\end{aligned}\]</span> In this special case, we thus have <span class="math inline">\(a_{k \sigma}^{+}\left|E_{0}\right\rangle\)</span> which is an eigenstate of <span class="math inline">\(H _{0}\)</span>. Continuing, we obtain: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}\left|\varphi_{0}(t)\right\rangle &amp;=\exp \left(\frac{ i }{\hbar} H _{0} t\right) a_{ k \sigma}^{+} \exp \left(-\frac{ i }{\hbar} H _{0} t\right)\left|E_{0}\right\rangle=\\&amp;=\exp \left(-\frac{ i }{\hbar} E_{0} t\right) \exp \left(\frac{ i }{\hbar} H _{0} t\right)\left(a_{ k \sigma}^{+}\left|E_{0}\right\rangle\right)=\\&amp;=\exp \left(\frac{ i }{\hbar}(\varepsilon( k )-\mu) t\right)\left(a_{k \sigma}^{+}\left|E_{0}\right\rangle\right)\end{aligned}\]</span> Due to <span class="math inline">\(|k|&gt;k_{ F }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle E_{0} \mid E_{0}\right\rangle=1,\)</span> we also have: <span class="math display">\[\left\langle E_{0}\left|a_{k \sigma} a_{k \sigma}^{+}\right| E_{0}\right\rangle=\left\langle E_{0} \mid E_{0}\right\rangle-\left\langle E_{0}\left|a_{k \sigma}^{+} a_{k \sigma}\right| E_{0}\right\rangle=1\]</span> We then finally obtain: <span class="math display">\[\left\langle\varphi_{0}(t) \mid \varphi_{0}\left(t^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle=\exp \left[-\frac{ i }{\hbar}(\varepsilon( k )-\mu)\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\right]\]</span> The propagator <span class="math inline">\(S_{k \sigma}^{(0)}\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\)</span> thus represents an undamped harmonic oscillation, as we have already seen by another method. Its frequency corresponds to an exact excitation energy of the system, namely <span class="math inline">\((\varepsilon( k )-\mu) .\)</span> Because of <span class="math display">\[\left|\left\langle\varphi_{0}(t) \mid \varphi_{0}\left(t^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle\right|^{2}=1\]</span> this is a stationary state (see Fig. 3.5 ).</p>]]></content>

id="文小刚教授的拓扑序">文小刚教授的“<strong>拓扑序</strong>”</h3><blockquote><p>文小刚教授提出的“<strong>拓扑序</strong>”和拓扑绝缘体的关系？</p></blockquote><ol type="1"><li>“<strong>拓扑序</strong>”提出的动机</li></ol><p>1989年的时候，很多人在做高温超导体，其中一个方向是用自旋液体来理解高温超导体。当时文小刚跟Anthony Zee（徐一鸿）和Wilczek一起研究手征自旋液体。</p><p>文小刚发现有许多不同的手征自旋液体，它们可以有完全相同的对称性，这是非常奇怪的现象。因为以前大家公认，朗道对称性理论可以描写所有的物态，但有很多不同手征自旋液体，对称性完全相同，所以不能用朗道对称性破缺理论来区分它们。这就表示，这些手征自旋液体中间有新的序，是不能用对称性来抓住的。</p><ol start="2" type="1"><li>为什么取名为“<strong>拓扑序</strong>”</li></ol><p>拓扑序是一种新的物质组织结构，它完全超出了朗道对称性破缺理论，是一种新的物态。因为是一种新的物质态，要起个名字，所以文小刚教授当时就把它叫作“拓扑序”。</p><p>拓扑序跟超弦里的拓扑场论有些关系。拓扑就是这样跑到凝聚态里面去了。以前拓扑不是来描写物质态的，都是用来描写它的缺陷、涡旋之类的。这次是第一次用“拓扑”这个词来描写一个新的物质态。</p><ol start="3" type="1"><li>“<strong>拓扑序</strong>”和拓扑绝缘的概念混淆</li></ol><p>简单的说就是：拓扑绝缘体没有拓扑序。其实拓扑绝缘体是一种对称保护物质态，而拓扑序则完全不需要对称性保护。</p><p>这个误解起源于2006年，Kane和Mele发表了一篇题为“Z2拓扑序和量子自旋霍尔效应”（Z2 Topological Order and the Quantum Spin Hall Effect）的文章。这篇文章的题目造成了一些概念上的混乱。</p><p>这篇文章的结论是，即使没有量子自旋霍尔效应，我们也会有非平凡的绝缘体。这一结果非常让人吃惊。这个绝缘体后来被别人叫做“拓扑绝缘体”。这是一篇很重要的文章，它开启了拓扑绝缘体这一非常活跃的领域。</p><p>但文章题目里的“拓扑序”则是误导。“拓扑序”这个概念已经在1989年被清楚地定义了。根据那个定义，拓扑绝缘体没有拓扑序。</p><ol start="4" type="1"><li>拓扑序和拓扑绝缘体物理特性的不同</li></ol><p>拓扑序有分数电荷和分数统计的元激发，有演生的规范场。有的拓扑序有破坏不了的零电阻导电表面。这些现象在拓扑绝缘体中都不出现。其实拓扑绝缘体到底有什么物理特性，不是一个简单的问题。很多文章（如维基百科）中讲的拓扑绝缘体的物理特性常常是不正确的。比如有人说拓扑绝缘体的特征是有导电的表面，其实平凡的绝缘体也可以有导电的表面，而拓扑绝缘体的表面有时也可以不导电。其实拓扑绝缘体真正的物理特征是知道的。只不过很多科普文章老是讲那些不是特征的特征。</p><ol start="5" type="1"><li>拓扑序早期的“冷落”与兴起</li></ol><p>在最开始的十年里，几乎没有人承认拓扑序是一个有用的概念，没有人理会这方面的工作。幸好拓扑序的一个延伸工作——边界态理论——有和实验可以比较的结果，得到了大家的承认。这里值得一提的是，边界态理论用标准凝聚态物理方法做不出来，需要用共形场论才行。这正好又发挥了文小刚超弦背景的优势。</p><p>2006年以后，有一类超出朗道对称性破缺理论的相—拓扑绝缘体被发现了。拓扑绝缘体和Haldane相一样也是一种对称保护拓扑相。实验很快制造出了这种材料，有很多实验是来实现拓扑绝缘体的。因为与实验有关系，所以有许多人感兴趣。</p><p>拓扑序概念后来被Kitaev应用于量子计算，引入了拓扑量子计算的概念。</p><ol start="6" type="1"><li>拓扑序的后续发展</li></ol><p>2006到2010年之间，文小刚教授和Levin、陈谐以及顾正澄的工作揭示了拓扑序的本质就是长程量子纠缠。长程量子纠缠是一个全新的物理现象，它可以导出一大类新的物质态。</p><p>作为一个全新的物理现象，长程量子纠缠需要新的数学来描写，如张量范畴学、群上同调理论等等。为了描写物理体系中的对称性，我们把群论引入到物理学中。为了描写量子材料中的量子纠缠，这次我们又把张量范畴学、群上同调论引入到物理学中。这是数学和物理又一次在深层次上的完美结合。</p><h2

target="_blank" rel="noopener">《瑞克和莫蒂》第3季第7集</a></li></ol><h2 id="有趣的语言">有趣的语言</h2><p>B站的up主<code>李好帅</code>写了一篇仿《百年孤独》的文章，梗很多，非常有趣。原文在视频里 <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13E411v7kP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">用B站的方式打开《百年孤独》</a></p><blockquote><p>多年以后，面对百万粉丝李好帅，将会回想起第一次在B站上传视频的那个遥远的下午。那时头套里胶水的刺鼻气味还未散去，站在户外拍摄，路人侧目，宛如智障。节目新生伊始，人们还不知如何形容他，支支吾吾说是一个大方头，在说书。节目诞生后的第一条弹幕由五个字组成，包含一条语法错误。这条弹幕在键盘上被敲击出来后，先在屏幕滚动了一遍，然后从屏幕的最左边绕到了屏幕后方，顺着桌子滑到了墙角，等有人开门时跟着窜了出去，来到街道上躲开了车水马龙，沿着路边的道鸭子向李好帅所在的城市方向划去。一位语文老师在路上看到了这条弹幕，侧身驻足，皱了皱眉，又继续向前走。这条弹幕顺着河流一直飘，又翻过了几座高山，上了高速公路。贴在了一辆车的轮胎上，跟着轮胎转了一百四十二万五千六百多圈，终于出了高速，又顺着马路继续向前滚动，来到了李好帅家附近。这条弹幕好几次躲开了野猫的追逐，却被一只麻雀叼到了树上，一阵风袭来，树叶被吹落，这条弹幕就附着在一片树叶上，向李好 帅的窗户飘去。就在李好帅起身关窗的一瞬间，弹幕在树叶上一跃，从即将关闭的窗缝钻进了屋子，悄悄地爬到了显示器后面。等李好帅回身再次坐到电脑前，这条弹幕从显示器右方绕了出来，融入到了屏幕里，滚动在了视频最上方。这时李小帅看到了Simple Read 的这个节目的第一条弹幕，五个字"讲的蛮好的"。而之前那个在路边瞥到了这条弹幕的语文老师，第二天在语文课上花了二十分钟去跟同学们强调语法中“的地得”的用法。</p><p>在B站每一个节目在第一期上传的那一瞬间，都会有一串长长的代码嵌入其中，宛如一本写满了神秘文字的羊皮卷，预言了这个节目的宿命。曾经有粉丝想要破译这串代码，他使用了失传已久的量子波动速读，学习了世界上所有的编程语言。但即便如此，当他面对那一长串代码时，也未能读懂一字一句。这个名叫哔哩哔哩的世界的造物主，曾与一个名叫孤独的魔鬼立下赌约，看谁能从对方手中俘获更多的灵魂。为了帮助世人。对抗孤独，他赋予了人们一件武器“弹幕”，在一串串弹幕中，孤独感被慢慢消解。这位造物主会向那些在对抗孤独中表现出色的up主颁发奖章。当拯救了十万孤独灵魂时，那个奖章是银色的；当拯救的孤独灵魂达到一百万时，那个奖章银色的表面会退去，金黄的底色将呈现出来。然而在这个世界中，孤独的生长从不停歇。每一次人们欢快地打出哈哈哈和233后，孤独感会枯萎殆尽，可夜深人静时又悄然滋长起来。就这样周而复始，如命运轮回般永不停歇的拉锯。</p><p>而李好帅对待孤独的方式有些不同，他从不抗拒孤独，而是把每次袭来的孤独感都一口口吃下去。吃的时候还会拿起一本书一起咀嚼，时间长了，孤独感多了，吃的书也就多了，肚子慢慢大了起来，这也使他鼓鼓的肚腩成为了粉丝们最为津津乐道的标志。他把孤独感和书籍吃进去，又把这份孤独随着书籍说了出来，录制成了节目讲给大家听。就这样一直循环往复，粉丝也渐渐多了起来。</p><p>这期间始终有人尝试破译嵌在 Simple Read 的这个节目中的那一长串代码，但所有人都无功而返，没有人能读出这串代码所揭示的这个节目的宿命和预言。直到节目的第一百万粉丝点击了关注，他开始对这一串代码产生了兴趣，便钻研了起来。他像着了魔一般废寝忘食，每天几乎不睡觉，不停的盯着这段代码苦思冥想。随着没日没夜的研究，他的头发渐渐变得稀疏。身边的朋友都以为他去当程序员了，不时还会向他投去怜悯的目光。但他依旧一言不发，潜心钻研着这段代码。他发现随着他头发的减少，代码逐渐变得清晰了起来。头发掉得越多，代码呈现出来的文字也就越清楚。原来封印这段代码的是来自古老程序员的诅咒。破解这段代码并不在于复杂的计算机语言，而是需要用破解者自己的发量去献祭。直到一天，这位粉丝仅剩了两三根头发，他又坐在了代码前，继续着他的破译。当年把 Simple Read 的第一条弹幕吹进好帅家里的那一阵风又吹了回来，俘获这位粉丝的头顶，最后那几根头发被吹落飘下。可是他并没有理会，因为他眼前的代码终于全部清晰了起来，仿佛一本尘封已久、写满了预言的羊皮卷呈现在他面前。这里预言了 Simple Read 这个节目从诞生到消亡的全部过程。代码的第一句这样写着：</p><p>节目的第一位粉丝语文不及格，最后一位粉丝头发掉光了。他摸了摸自己的头，感觉有点凉，又继续向后读，读到了每一期节目的文案，读到了人们的讨论和转发。他读得如此入神，没有发觉屏幕里 Simple Read 的节目的弹幕和评论开始一条条消失。点赞、投币、收藏和转发图标下的那些数字如电影回放一般快速减少，视频变得越来越模糊，声音变得越来越微弱。他继续向后读，可是看着看着，快到最后他停下了，他发现代码上早已清楚地预言了他此时此刻正在经历的一切。预言了最后一位粉丝正在读这段代码的最后几段，他快速跳过几行，想知道 Simple Read 的这个节目后来怎么样了。但没等到最后，他便已经明白自己不会再看到这个节目，也永远不会再记得这个节目。因为当预言了这个节目命运的代码被最后一位粉丝成功破译时。这段代码和这个节目也将从互联网上抹去，从世人记忆中根除。节目中所说的一切，自永远至永远不会再重复，因为注定汇聚了百万粉丝孤独的节目不会有第二次机会出现在互联网上。</p></blockquote><p></br></p><p class="note note-primary">王小波</p><blockquote><p>在我小的时候，常有一种冰凉的恐怖使我从睡梦中惊醒，我久久地凝视着黑夜。我不明白我为什么会死。到我死时，一切感觉都会停止，我会消失在一片混沌之中。我害怕毫无感觉，宁愿有一种感觉长久存在。哪怕它是疼。</p><p>长大了一点的时候，我开始苦苦思索。我知道宇宙和永恒是无限的，而我自己和一切人一样都是有限的。我非常非常不喜欢这个对比，老想把它否定掉。于是我开始思考是否有一种比人和人类更伟大的意义。想明白了从人的角度看来这种意义是不存在的以后，我面前就出现了一片寂寞的大海。人们所做的一切不过是些死前的游戏……</p><p>在冥想之中长大了以后，我开始喜欢诗。我读过很多诗，其中有一些是真正的好诗。好诗描述过的事情各不相同，韵律也变化无常，但是都有一点相同的东西。它有一种水晶般的光辉，好象是来自星星……真希望能永远读下去，打破这个寂寞的大海。我希望自己能写这样的诗。我希望自己也是一颗星星。如果我会发光，就不必害怕黑暗。如果我自己是那么美好，那么一切恐惧就可以烟消云散。于是我开始存下了一点希望——如果我能做到，那么我就战胜了寂寞的命运。</p><p>但是我好久好久没有动笔写，我不敢拿那么重大的希望去冒险。如果我写出来糟不可言，那么一切都完了。</p><p>我十七岁到南方去插队。旱季里，那儿的天空是蓝湛湛的，站在小竹楼里往四下看，四处的竹林翠绿而又苗条。天上的云彩又洁白又丰腴，缓缓地浮过。我觉得应该试一试。</p><p>开始时候像初恋一样神秘，我想避开别人来试试自己。午夜时分，我从床上溜下来，听着别人的鼻息，悄悄地走到窗前去，在皎洁的月光下坐着想。似乎有一些感受、一些模糊不清的字句，不知写下来是什么样的。在月光下，我用自来水笔在一面镜子上写。写出的字句幼稚得可怕。我涂了又写，写了又涂，直到把镜子涂成暗蓝色，把手指和手掌全涂成蓝色才罢手。回到床上，我哭了。这好象是一个更可怕的噩梦。</p><p>——《爱你就像爱生命》</p></blockquote><h4

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>刚上大学的时候，看到这一篇文章。被这种深刻的思考，辽阔的情怀所感动。希望自己也可以成为这样的人，后来人生的许多思考也是基于这里的思考出发。</p><blockquote><p>这是爱因斯坦于1918年4月在柏林物理学会举办的麦克斯•普朗克六十岁生日庆祝会上的讲话。讲稿最初发表在1918年出版的《庆祝麦克斯•普朗克60寿辰：德国物理学会演讲集》。1932年爱因斯坦将此文略加修改，作为普朗克文集《科学往何处去？》的序言。</p></blockquote><h3 id="探索的动机">探索的动机</h3><p>在科学的殿堂里有许多房舍，住在里面的人真是各式各样，而引导他们到那里去的动机实在也各不相同。有许多人爱好科学是因为科学给他们以超乎常人的智力上的快感，科学是他们自己的特殊娱乐，他们在这种娱乐中寻求生动活泼的经验和雄心壮志的满足；在这座庙堂里，另外还有许多人所以把他们的脑力产物奉献在祭坛上，为的是纯粹功利的目的。如果上帝有位天使跑来把所有属于这两类的人都赶出殿堂，那末聚集在那里的人就会大大减少，但是，仍然会有一些人留在里面，其中有古人，也有今人。我们的普朗克就是其中之一，这也就是我们所以爱戴他的原因。</p><p>我很明白，我们刚才在想象中随便驱逐了许多卓越的人物，他们对建设科学殿堂有过很大的也许是主要的贡献；在许多情况下我们的天使也会觉得难以做出决定。但有一点我可以肯定，如果殿堂里只有我们刚才驱逐了的那两类人，那末这座殿堂就决不会存在，正如只有蔓草就不成其为森林一样。因为，对于这些人来说，只要有机会，人类活动的任何领域他们都会去干：他们究竟成为工程师，官吏，商人，还是科学家，完全取决于环境。现在让我们再来看看那些为天使所宠爱的人吧。</p><p>他们大多数是相当怪僻、沉默寡言和孤独的人，但尽管有这些共同特点，实际上他们彼此之间很不一样，不像被赶走的那许多人那样彼此相似。究竟是什么力量把他们引到这座殿堂里来的呢？这是一个难题，不能笼统地用一句话来回答。首先我同意叔本华所说的，把人们引向艺术和科学的最强烈的动机之一，是要逃避日常生活中令人厌恶的粗俗和使人绝望的沉闷，是要摆脱人们自己反复无常的欲望的桎梏。一个修养有素的人总是渴望逃避个人生活而进入客观知觉和思维的世界；这种愿望好比城市里的人渴望逃避喧嚣拥挤的环境，而到高山上享受幽寂的生活，在那里，透过清寂而纯洁的空气，可以自由地眺望，陶醉于那似乎是为永恒而设计的宁静景色。</p><p>除了这种消极的动机以外，还有一种积极的动机。<strong>人们总想以最适当的方式来画出一幅简化的和易领悟的世界图像，于是他就试图用他的这种世界体系（cosmos）来代替经验的世界，并来征服它。这就是画家、诗人、思辨哲学家和自然科学家所做的。</strong>他们都按自己的方式去做。<strong>各人都把世界体系及其构成作为他的感情生活的支点，以便由此找到他在个人经验的狭小范围内所不能找到的宁静和安定。</strong></p><p>理论物理学家的世界图像在所有这些可能的图像中占有什么地位呢？它在描述各种关系时要求尽可能达到最高标准的严格精确性，这样的标准只有用数学语言才能达到。另一方面，物理学家对于他的主题必须极其严格地加以限制，他必须满足于描述我们的经验领域里的最简单事件；企图以理论物理学家所要求的精密性和逻辑完备性来重现一切比较复杂的事件，这不是人类智力所能及的。高度的纯粹性、明晰性和确定性要以完整性为代价。但是当人们畏缩而胆怯地不去管一切不可捉摸和比较复杂的东西时，那么能吸引我们去认识自然界的这一渺小部分的究竟又是什么呢？难道这种谨小慎微的努力结果也够得上宇宙理论的美名吗？</p><p>我认为，是够得上的；因为，作为理论物理学结构基础的普遍定律，应当对任何自然现象都有效。有了它们，就有可能借助于单纯的演绎得出一切自然过程（包括生命）的描述，也就是说得出关于这些过程的理论，只要这种演绎过程并不太多地超出人类理智能力。因此，物理学家放弃他的世界体系的完整性，倒不是一个什么根本原则性的问题。</p><p>物理学家的最高使命是要得到那些普遍的基本定律，由此世界体系就能用单纯的演绎法建立起来。要通向这些定律，并没有逻辑的道路，只有通过那种以对经验的共鸣的理解为依据的直觉，才能得到这些定律。由于有这种方法论上的不确定性，人们可以假定，会有许多个同样站得住脚的理论物理体系，这个看法在理论上无疑是正确的。但是，物理学的发展表明，在某一时期里，在所有可想到的解释中，总有一个显得比别的都要高明得多。凡是真正深入研究过这问题的人，都不会否认唯一决定理论体系的，实际上是现象世界，尽管在现象和他们的理论原理之间并没有逻辑的桥梁；这就是莱布尼兹非常中肯地表述过的“先定的和谐”。物理学家往往责备认识论者对这个事实没有给予足够的注意。我认为，几年前马赫同普朗克之间所进行的论战的根源就在于此。</p><p><strong>渴望看到这种先定的和谐，是无穷的毅力和耐心的源泉。</strong>我们看到，普朗克就是因此而专心致志于这门科学中的最普遍的问题，而不使自己分心于比较愉快的和容易达到的目标上去。我常常听到同事们试图把他的这种态度归因于非凡的意志力和修养，但我认为这是错误的。促使人们去做这种工作的精神状态是同信仰宗教的人或谈恋爱的人的精神状态相类似的；他们每天的努力并非来自深思熟虑的意向或计划，而是直接来自激情。我们敬爱的普朗克就坐在这里，内心在笑我像孩子一样提着第欧根尼的灯闹着玩。我们对他的爱戴不需要作老生常谈的说明，祝愿他对科学的热爱继续照亮他未来的道路，并引导他去解决今天物理学的最重要的问题，这问题是他自己提出来的，并且为了解决这问题他已经做了很多工作。祝他成功地把量子论同电动力学和力学统一于一个单一的逻辑体系里。</p><h3 id="英文版">英文版</h3><blockquote><p>"Principles of Research", by Albert Einstein</p><p>The following piece was a speech written by Albert Einstein for Max Planck's 60th birthday.</p></blockquote><p>In the temple of science are many mansions, and various indeed are they that dwell therein and the motives that have led them thither. Many take to science out of a joyful sense of superior intellectual power; science is their own special sport to which they look for vivid experience and the satisfaction of ambition; many others are to be found in the temple who have offered the products of their brains on this altar for purely utilitarian purposes. Were an angel of the Lord to come and drive all the people belonging to these two categories out of the temple, the assemblage would be seriously depleted, but there would still be some men, of both present and past times, left inside. Our Planck is one of them, and that is why we love him.</p><p>I am quite aware that we have just now light-heartedly expelled in imagination many excellent men who are largely, perhaps chiefly, responsible for the building of the temple of science; and in many cases our angel would find it a pretty ticklish job to decide. But of one thing I feel sure: if the types we have just expelled were the only types there were, the temple would never have come to be, any more than a forest can grow which consists of nothing but creepers. For these people any sphere of human activity will do, if it comes to a point; whether they become engineers, officers, tradesmen, or scientists depends on circumstances. Now let us have another look at those who have found favor with the angel. Most of them are somewhat odd, uncommunicative, solitary fellows, really less like each other, in spite of these common characteristics, than the hosts of the rejected. What has brought them to the temple? That is a difficult question and no single answer will cover it. To begin with, I believe with Schopenhauer that one of the strongest motives that leads men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from personal life into the world of objective perception and thought; this desire may be compared with the townsman's irresistible longing to escape from his noisy, cramped surroundings into the silence of high mountains, where the eye ranges freely through the still, pure air and fondly traces out the restful contours apparently built for eternity.</p><p>With this negative motive there goes a positive one. Man tries to make for himself in the fashion that suits him best a simplified and intelligible picture of the world; he then tries to some extent to substitute this cosmos of his for the world of experience, and thus to overcome it. This is what the painter, the poet, the speculative philosopher, and the natural scientist do, each in his own fashion. Each makes this cosmos and its construction the pivot of his emotional life, in order to find in this way the peace and security which he cannot find in the narrow whirlpool of personal experience.</p><p>What place does the theoretical physicist's picture of the world occupy among all these possible pictures? It demands the highest possible standard of rigorous precision in the description of relations, such as only the use of mathematical language can give. In regard to his subject matter, on the other hand, the physicist has to limit himself very severely: he must content himself with describing the most simple events which can be brought within the domain of our experience; all events of a more complex order are beyond the power of the human intellect to reconstruct with the subtle accuracy and logical perfection which the theoretical physicist demands. Supreme purity, clarity, and certainty at the cost of completeness. But what can be the attraction of getting to know such a tiny section of nature thoroughly, while one leaves everything subtler and more complex shyly and timidly alone? Does the product of such a modest effort deserve to be called by the proud name of a theory of the universe?</p><p>In my belief the name is justified; for the general laws on which the structure of theoretical physics is based claim to be valid for any natural phenomenon whatsoever. With them, it ought to be possible to arrive at the description, that is to say, the theory, of every natural process, including life, by means of pure deduction, if that process of deduction were not far beyond the capacity of the human intellect. The physicist's renunciation of completeness for his cosmos is therefore not a matter of fundamental principle.</p><p>The supreme task of the physicist is to arrive at those universal elementary laws from which the cosmos can be built up by pure deduction. There is no logical path to these laws; only intuition, resting on sympathetic understanding of experience, can reach them. In this methodological uncertainty, one might suppose that there were any number of possible systems of theoretical physics all equally well justified; and this opinion is no doubt correct, theoretically. But the development of physics has shown that at any given moment, out of all conceivable constructions, a single one has always proved itself decidedly superior to all the rest. Nobody who has really gone deeply into the matter will deny that in practice the world of phenomena uniquely determines the theoretical system, in spite of the fact that there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles; this is what Leibnitz described so happily as a "pre-established harmony." Physicists often accuse epistemologists of not paying sufficient attention to this fact. Here, it seems to me, lie the roots of the controversy carried on some years ago between Mach and Planck.</p><p>The longing to behold this pre-established harmony is the source of the inexhaustible patience and perseverance with which Planck has devoted himself, as we see, to the most general problems of our science, refusing to let himself be diverted to more grateful and more easily attained ends. I have often heard colleagues try to attribute this attitude of his to extra-ordinary will-power and discipline -wrongly, in my opinion. The state of mind which enables a man to do work of this kind is akin to that of the religious worshiper or the lover; the daily effort comes from no deliberate intention or program, but straight from the heart. There he sits, our beloved Planck, and smiles inside himself at my childish playing-about with the lantern of Diogenes. Our affection for him needs no thread¬bare explanation. May the love of science continue to illumine his path in the future and lead him to the solution of the most important problem in present-day physics, which he has himself posed and done so much to solve. May he succeed in uniting quantum theory with electrodynamics and mechanics in a single logical system.</p>]]></content>
