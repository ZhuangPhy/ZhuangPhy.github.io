<p>[TOC]</p>
<h2 id="introduction">6.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>The aim of this chapter is to provide an introduction to the role of spin in systems of interacting electrons in conducting materials. To make this discussion manageable, we limit ourselves mainly to states with no long-range magnetic order and in vanishing external magnetic fields. Even under these simplifying conditions, the electron spin, in conjunction with the electronelectron interaction, can lead to subtle and remarkable co-operative phenomena. These include new kinds of 'normal' states and forms of superconductivity in which binding of Cooper pairs arises not from phonons, as in simple metals, but via the effects of spin fluctuations in the electron system itself.</p>
<h4 id="boundary-between-magnetic-and-non-magnetic-order">6.1.1 Boundary between magnetic and non-magnetic order</h4>
<p>The above phenomena may be found in conductors in which the Coulomb interaction leads to strong local, but not static, spin alignment. In this spin 'liquid' state, the electrons themselves may move rapidly, but the spin density they produce will appear to be undergoing slow and large-amplitude spontaneous fluctuations.</p>
<p>In a magnetic state of a conventional kind, e.g. in the case of ferromagnetism or anti-ferromagnetism, fluctuations of a particular wave vector have a static component of finite amplitude. We may imagine arriving at our spin liquid state by 'melting' this frozen-in magnetic order in some appropriate manner. This crossover from the frozen to the liquid state is quite different from that of normal phase transitions. In the latter, an ordered state melts with increasing temperature into a disordered state of higher entropy. But the melting process we are considering is at a fixed temperature as a function of some other control parameter, such as the strength of the screened electron-electron interaction. In practice, this may be achieved by varying the lattice spacing (via hydrostatic pressure) or the composition of the underlying atomic structure.</p>
<p>In the zero-temperature limit, such transitions involve no change in entropy. Hence, they cannot be viewed as transformations from order to disorder, but rather from conventional order to some more subtle 'hidden' order. In the latter, the conventional order parameter undergoes spontaneous quantum fluctuations with zero mean.</p>
<p>An example of this kind of quantum melting is the transition of solid helium- <span class="math inline">\(4\left({ }^{4} He \right)\)</span> to a liquid as a function of pressure at a low temperature below the <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> point. In the low-temperature limit, the latter is not less ordered than the former, i.e. both have zero entropy and are in well defined quantum states. But the nature of the underlying order in the quantum liquid state is subtle and more difficult to visualise than that of the solid.</p>
<p>Our spin problem is partly, but not wholly, analogous to that of <span class="math inline">\({ }^{4} He .\)</span> The solid would correspond to conventional magnetic alignment and the quantum liquid to a state characterised in part by quantum fluctuations in the spin density. But the spin is only one of the variables which can play a role in determining the nature of the new ordered state. since the electrons are itinerant, we must consider not only the spin, but also the charge and transverse current densities. The latter are clearly important in determining thermal and electrical conductivities as well as instabilities to superconducting phases. since all of these variables are in general coupled to each other, the number of possible ordered states may be considerable, and the results could depend sensitively on fine details of the electron orbitals and of the underlying lattice. In section 6.1 .2 we introduce a model which provides us with a tractable way of thinking about electron systems near the boundary separating magnetic and quantum spin liquid phases. The model has helped to shed light on a wide range of unusual phenomena observed in nearly magnetic d-metals. It also provides a qualitative background for the study of the heavy fermion compounds and of the copper oxide conductors. Systems such as these, which find themselves near the boundary between magnetic and non-magnetic order, are remarkably widespread. A reason for their pervasiveness arises quite naturally out of the model we shall develop.</p>
<h4 id="fermions-and-interaction-fields">6.1.2 Fermions and interaction fields</h4>
<p>It is conventional to begin a treatment of the properties of conducting materials with a model of electrons interacting with each other and an underlying lattice of ions via a static Coulomb interaction. For reasons which will become clear below, it is useful to begin at the still more fundamental level of quantum electrodynamics, namely the theory of matter and light (Feynman <span class="math inline">\(1985 ;\)</span> Feynman and Hibbs 1965 ). In this framework, the ground state is imagined to be a vacuum and the elementary excitations above this vacuum are Fermi and Bose particles, i.e. electrons and photons.</p>
<p>The bosons are the well known quanta of Maxwell's electromagnetic interaction field. The fermions, though usually treated as particles from the start, may also be imagined to be quanta of some fundamental field. The latter satisfies the Dirac equation (chapter 3 ) and its quantisation proceeds in a way analogous to that of Maxwell's field, but the operator used to replace the classical field is constructed in such a way as to guarantee that the resulting quanta will obey the Pauli principle.</p>
<p>This leads to a picture of two fields forming initially separate linear subsystems which are then coupled. The quanta of the matter field do not interact with each other directly, but only with the quanta of the interaction field. If the bosons are in a formal sense 'filtered out', we would then 'observe' fermions that appear to interact with each other via a retarded potential. The latter is the indirect effect of the exchange between fermions of the now 'hidden' bosons. This procedure, known as integrating out the boson field, can be made mathematically precise. <span class="math inline">\(^{\dagger}\)</span> For our purposes, however, it will be sufficient to rely on an analogy to conventional filtering.</p>
<h2 id="low-frequency-and-long-wavelength-phenomena">6.2 Low-frequency and long-wavelength phenomena</h2>
<p>With this brief outline of key ideas from quantum electrodynamics, we now return to our original problem. For simplicity, we confine our attention to phenomena involving spontaneous fluctuations of low frequency <span class="math inline">\(\left(\omega&lt;\omega_{ c }\right)\)</span> and small wave vectors <span class="math inline">\(\left(q&lt;q_{ c }\right) .\)</span> For now, we assume only that the cut-off wave vector <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> and frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{ c }\)</span> are small compared with the Brillouin zone dimension and the Fermi energy, respectively. It will turn out that some properties predicted by the model presented below depend mainly on the behaviour of the system in the limit of low <span class="math inline">\(q, \omega\)</span> and hence are relatively insensitive to the precise choice of <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{ c }\)</span></p>
<p>To focus attention on processes within <span class="math inline">\(q&lt;q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega&lt;\omega_{ c },\)</span> we may imagine formally filtering out all Fourier components of fluctuating variables outside of this window. In technical terms, this means integrating out the phonon and photon field components with <span class="math inline">\(q&gt;q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega&gt;\omega_{ c },\)</span> and the electron field components with wave vectors outside of a window of width of the order of <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> about the Fermi surface (Shankar 1994 ).</p>
<p>This procedure might be expected to lead to a picture somewhat analogous to that of the previous section. But the fermions in the new model will be defined only on a shell near the Fermi surface and will have a modified energy spectrum. The bosons in the filtered description can also be radically different from the original phonons and photons. As in quantum electrodynamics, the fermions emit and absorb these bosons and hence experience a new kind of retarded interaction, which may be viewed as a screened version of the original potential.</p>
<p>Within this picture, the key problem is to identify the dominant part of the boson field, or the induced interaction it produces, and attempt to model its main properties in a tractable fashion. At this stage, it might be supposed that a reasonable starting point for this effective interaction is simply the conventional Thomas-Fermi potential or its generalisation in terms of standard dielectric theory. But for a system close to a magnetic phase transition, a still more important interaction field emerges out of the complex filtering process which we have carried out.</p>
<h4 id="the-exchange-field">6.2.1 The exchange field</h4>
<p>To understand the nature of this new dynamical interaction field, we return to the original concept of an exchange molecular field introduced in phenomenological descriptions of magnetism (White 1983 ). In this treatment, the effects of the electron-electron interaction acting through constraints imposed by the Pauli principle may be described in terms of an effective magnetic field which couples to the electron spin (and not to the current) and which varies in proportion to the uniform magnetisation. This implies that in an applied magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(H,\)</span> the magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> will satisfy <span class="math inline">\(M=\chi_{0}(H+\lambda M),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda M\)</span> is the exchange field, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a coupling constant, and <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{0}\)</span> is the magnetic susceptibility when <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> Solving for <span class="math inline">\(M,\)</span> we obtain a final susceptibility of the well known form <span class="math inline">\(\chi=\chi_{0} /\left(1-\lambda \chi_{0}\right),\)</span> which is enhanced over <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{0}\)</span> in the normal case where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is positive. For <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \chi_{0} \geqslant 1,\)</span> the feedback produced by the exchange field is critical or over-critical, and magnetic polarisation can occur spontaneously in the absence of the applied field. As in the analogous problem of a self-oscillating feedback amplifier, the amplitude of the spontaneous polarisation in the over-critical state is governed by anharmonicities. In the model developed in section <span class="math inline">\(6.3,\)</span> the non-linear dependence of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> may be described in the form <span class="math inline">\(H=a M+b M^{3}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> given above and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the anharmonicity parameter (Edwards and Wohlfarth 1968 ). In the over-critical regime, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is negative and the magnetisation in zero external field grows spontaneously to a magnitude <span class="math inline">\((-a / b)^{1 / 2}\)</span> limited by the coefficient of the non-linear term in <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></p>
<p>This conventional description is normally applied to the uniform average magnetisation alone. It is now proposed to extend the concept of an exchange field to deal with space- and time-varying processes with <span class="math inline">\(q, \omega\)</span> components in our specified window. This interaction field is then dynamical and forms a subsystem in analogy to the electromagnetic field in the original problem.</p>
<p>In this way, we arrive at a low-frequency and long-wavelength model consisting of fermions in a narrow range close to the Fermi surface plus the exchange field. As in the starting theory of section <span class="math inline">\(6.1,\)</span> the fermions do not interact directly with each other, but only with the exchange field itself. And if we filter out the latter, we are led to a picture of fermions which appear to be coupled via a retarded and spin-dependent interaction that originates from the now 'invisible' exchange field.</p>
<p>It is helpful to view this unfamiliar interaction field as analogous to the more primitive counterpart in quantum electrodynamics. It fluctuates spontaneously, and on average will 'follow' the time- and space-varying magnetisation set up by the spins of the fermions qualitatively in the way that the electromagnetic field, through Maxwell's equations, may respond on average to the charge and current densities of the electrons.</p>
<p>The model of fermions and an interaction field related to the magnetisation incorporates the twin features raised in section <span class="math inline">\(6.1 .\)</span> Namely, it describes both the itineracy of the electrons and the importance of slow magnetisation fluctuations in the spin liquid state. The fermions in the model describe the former, while the interaction field will allow us to incorporate the latter feature.</p>
<h4 id="fermi-liquid-model">6.2.2 Fermi liquid model</h4>
<p>The basic scattering processes which may occur in this low-frequency and long-wavelength world can be summarised as follows. First, the fermions may undergo single transitions (within their restricted shell near the Fermi level) via the emission or absorption of the exchange field. The strong constraint imposed by the Pauli principle on these transitions at low temperatures normally allows us to extract useful results in leading order in perturbation theory, i.e. in the Born approximation which yields the fermion scattering rate or lifetime.</p>
<p>Secondly, fermions may first emit and then recapture the same exchange ficld. This process may be interpreted as a self-interaction, which leads, as in the corresponding classical theory of the electron, to a renormalisation of the effective mass, or more generally of the apparent energy spectrum, of the fermions. This spectrum for a chosen state near the Fermi level may be determined via a final filtering process in which the interaction field and all states, except the one in question, are formally integrated out. The fermions characterised by this fully renormalised spectrum will be called quasiparticles.</p>
<p>We note that the self-interaction leads us not only to the quasi-particle mass but also to the lifetime which we discussed above in terms of single emission and absorption processes. The mass and lifetime of a quasi-particle, or more generally the real and imaginary parts of the quasi-particle energy spectrum, normally determine the heat capacity and (under suitable conditions) the resistivity of the interacting electrons.</p>
<p>In a paramagnetic state well away from a magnetic instability, the above model yields linear and quadratic temperature dependencies, respectively, for the heat capacity <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and the resistivity <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> at a low temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. We note that <span class="math inline">\(C / T\)</span> is proportional to the average of the quasi-particle mass on the Fermi surface at low temperatures. In a similar way, it is useful to view <span class="math inline">\(\rho / T^{2}\)</span> as a measure of an effective scattering cross-section. This cross-section is that for a quasi-particle colliding with another quasi-particle via the full induced inter- action which we have described, and before account is taken of the <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> factor arising from the constraint imposed by the Pauli principle on allowed scattering processes.</p>
<p>This behaviour of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is that expected for the Standard Model, known as the Landau Fermi liquid theory, which may be viewed as an extension and generalisation of the traditional single-particle description of conduction electron systems (Baym and Pethick 1991 ). The Fermi liquid model, in both its early and final modern forms, has played a central role in the physics of condensed matter since the development of quantum mechanics (chapter 5 ).</p>
<h4 id="breakdown-of-the-fermi-liquid-description">6.2.3 Breakdown of the Fermi liquid description</h4>
<p>As the magnetic instability is approached, and spontaneous magnetic fluctuations slow down and grow in amplitude, the normal Fermi liquid description for the temperature dependence of thermal and transport properties may break down.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we consider a homogeneous isotropic model of an electron system near a ferromagnetic instability in three spatial dimensions. It will be argued in section 6.4 that the temperature dependence of the heat capacity and resistivity should in this case have the anomalous forms <span class="math inline">\(C \propto T \ln \left(T^{*} / T\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho \propto T^{5 / 3},\)</span> in place of the usual linear and quadratic variations, respectively, of the normal Fermi liquid model. This anomalous behaviour, which is found to be consistent with recent high-pressure studies of certain cubic d-metal ferromagnets, is associated with a state known as the marginal Fermi liquid (Baym and Pethick 1991 ).</p>
<p>If we interpret, as in section <span class="math inline">\(6.2 .2, C / T \propto \ln \left(T^{*} / T\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho / T^{2} \propto T^{-1 / 3}\)</span> as the quasi-particle mass and cross-section, respectively, we are led to the conclusion that, in the above state, the quasi-particle properties are singular and hence ill defined in the <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow 0\)</span> limit.</p>
<p>This apparent divergence of the quasi-particle 'size', as defined via the mass and cross-section, may be attributed to the fact that the range of the induced interaction tends to grow without limit at the critical point, i.e. where the magnetic transition temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c } \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> This induced interaction arises essentially as follows. A fermion introduced into the system on the verge of a magnetic instability will nucleate local spin order which radiates outward. The magnetisation induced by this first fermion then produces an exchange field that can act on the spin of a second fermion some distance away. The range of this indirect coupling should grow as the tendency for long-range order increases, i.e. the range should vary as the magnetic correlation length which diverges at a continuous phase transition. It is plausible that the cross-section for quasi-particle-quasi-particle scattering and the quasi-particle mass would then also exhibit anomalous behaviour. <span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span></p>
<p>Let us recall that this spin-spin interaction originates from the spinindependent Coulomb potential itself in conjunction with the spin-dependent effects of the Pauli principle. The true magnetic interaction arising from Maxwell's fields, i.e. the current-current and dipole-dipole couplings, can also remain long range at the end of the screening process. But these are very weak compared with the Coulomb potential and (at least in three dimensions) are expected to lead to a breakdown of the Fermi liquid description only at extremely low temperatures and in metals of extraordinarily high conductivity. We may then summarise our results as follows. In the paramagnetic state, well away from the critical point, the range of the residual spin-spin interaction is short, and the normal Fermi liquid model describes the low-temperature properties with essentially constant quasi-particle mass and cross-section.</p>
<p>As the critical point is approached and the interaction grows in intensity and range, the mass and cross-section increase in magnitude and, though still finite as <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow 0,\)</span> become strongly temperature dependent. This is the heavy fermion behaviour found frequently among nearly ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic f-electron compounds as well as certain d-metals and low-dimensional conductors (see Coleman <span class="math inline">\(1995 a , b\)</span> and chapter 5 in this volume). Finally, at the critical point of a continuous phase transition, the effective interaction and, hence, the quasi-particle properties become strongly temperature dependent and singular as <span class="math inline">\(T \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> In this limit, the concept of a fermion quasi-particle becomes ill defined. A singular mass would imply, for example, that a quasiparticle state of a given wave vector has a vanishing probability of being connected with a normal fermion state of the same wave vector. Hence, the conventional association of quasi-particles with single electrons breaks down. Finally, we comment that the range of applicability of non-Fermi liquid models as developed in section 6.3 is not restricted to the critical point alone. Anomalous temperature dependences of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> are both expected and observed over wide ranges in both temperature and the control parameter (e.g. pressure) used to cross the boundary between magnetic and non-magnetic states.</p>
<h4 id="anisotropic-superconductivity">6.2.4 Anisotropic superconductivity</h4>
<p>In section 6.2 .3 we considered the breakdown of the Fermi liquid description due to the long-range nature of the induced interaction. But this is not the only way in which the effective interaction can destabilise the normal state. In particular, a second condition for the stability of the conventional Fermi liquid, namely the requirement that the effective interaction must be repulsive, can also be violated for our indirect spin-spin coupling. In an isotropic model, this coupling is proportional to the inner product of the spins of interacting fermion pairs and hence can be attractive or repulsive depending on the relative spin orientation.</p>
<p>In nearly ferromagnetic systems, the effective spin coupling tends to be attractive for fermions of the same spin. This favours the formation of Cooper pairs of parallel spins and, under suitable conditions at sufficiently low temperatures, can lead to an unusual kind of superconductivity.</p>
<p>It differs from conventional superconductivity in that the pairing interaction is due to the exchange field itself rather than phonons and, since the spins are in a triplet state, the Cooper pairs form in p-wave rather than s-wave orbital states. The internal spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the former lead to superconducting order parameters with multiple components (chapter 7 ) and anisotropies not found in the conventional singlet s-wave counterparts (Leggett <span class="math inline">\(1975 ;\)</span> Sigrist and Ueda 1991 ).</p>
<p>Due to their anisotropic nature, p-wave, d-wave and higher-order superconducting states can be destabilised by scattering processes which are normally harmless to the isotropic s-wave systems. In particular, the anisotropic states are expected to be observed only when the carrier mean free path <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> exceeds the superconducting coherence length <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> (i.e. the characteristic spatial extent of the Cooper pair orbitals).</p>
<p>Anisotropic superconductivity is therefore most stable in systems in which <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is small. since the latter varies as the Fermi velocity and inversely as the superconducting energy gap, the heavy fermion systems (Steglich et al. 1979 ; Ott et al. <span class="math inline">\(1983 ;\)</span> Stewart <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. 1984 and others and the high-temperature (e.g. copper oxide) superconductors (Bednorz and Müller <span class="math inline">\(1986 ;\)</span> Wu et al. 1987 and others) are naturally favoured. Evidence for the existence of anisotropic superconductivity in some of these systems is now considerable. In most cases, however, the anisotropic states appear to be spin singlets with essentially dwave character. The latter would arise in the presence of interaction fields which have dominant components at high rather than low <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> e.g. as in incipient anti-ferromagnets rather than ferromagnets.</p>
<p>The simplest p-wave superconductivity consistent with the present model would be expected to exist in nearly ferromagnetic d-metals with weak spinorbit interaction. In the known candidates in this class, however, <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is expected to be one or two orders of magnitude greater than in the heavy fermions or high-temperature superconductors, respectively. This imposes conditions on carrier mean free paths beyond that achieved thus far, with the exception of the binary compound <span class="math inline">\(MnSi ^{*}\)</span> and the elemental metals. Among the latter, perhaps the most promising are the ferromagnets Co and <span class="math inline">\(Ni\)</span> at pressures high enough to suppress long-range magnetic order. found in one of these systems provided the magnetic to non-magnetic transition is not too abrupt and the inhomogeneities in the applied pressure do not lead to a breakdown of the requirement <span class="math inline">\(l \gg \xi\)</span></p>
<p>The high-pressure non-magnetic state of Ni might be similar to that of the isostructural and isoelectronic relatives <span class="math inline">\(Pd\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Pt\)</span>. Estimates based on the present model suggest, however, that the latter systems are already too far removed from the ferromagnetic instability to be viable candidates for the kind of superconductivity we are considering.</p>
<p>The simplest form of p-wave superconductivity remains elusive. A closely related but more complex state may exist in some of the uranium-based heavy fermion compounds. Also, a neutral analogue has been identified in the superfluid phases of liquid <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He in the low-millikelvin temperature range. The normal and superfluid properties of this neutral Fermi liquid are consistent with the model introduced in sections 6.3 and 6.4 for nearly ferromagnetic itinerant electron systems.</p>
<h4 id="additional-interaction-fields">6.2.5 Additional interaction fields</h4>
<p>Our focus on the exchange field associated with long-wavelength spin fluctuations limits our discussion to systems near ferromagnetic instabilities. The model presented in the next section can, however, be extended to describe the simplest examples of incipient anti-ferromagnetism in conducting materials. Other fluctuating variables, such as the charge density (for both the electrons and the ions) and the transverse current density, will also have their own corresponding molecular fields. The present treatment is restricted to those phenomena in which the exchange field, as defined more fully in the next section, plays the leading role.</p>
<h2 id="phenomenological-model">6.3 Phenomenological model</h2>
<h4 id="outline">6.3 .1 Outline</h4>
<p>Let us summarise the strategy intended to lead us to a tractable model for the phenomena reviewed in section <span class="math inline">\(6.2 .\)</span> The fundamental starting point, quantum electrodynamics of a dense system of electrons and ions interacting with photons, is of unimaginable complexity. since we are concerned only with lowtemperature phenomena, it is natural to reduce the apparent complexity by filtering out all but the low-frequency fluctuations in the relevant fields. Furthermore, except where otherwise stated, we also filter out all but the relatively low-wave-vector fluctuations expected to play the central role in the nearly ferromagnetic systems.</p>
<p>We assume that the system which we observe through our filter can still be described in terms of a model analogous in some respects to the starting theory. Thus, in the window defined by the cut-off parameters <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{ c }\)</span> introduced in section <span class="math inline">\(6.2,\)</span> we have, once again, fermions and interaction fields which are analogous to the electrons and the electromagnetic field, respectively, of the starting theory.</p>
<p>The analogy is, however, imperfect in several ways. In particular, the new model is not explicitly relativistic and the fermions are now defined only in a narrow shell (with thickness of the order <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> ) near the Fermi level. The latter implies that we cannot explicitly describe in the new model processes which involve transitions outside of this shell.</p>
<p>Except when prohibited by strict conservation principles, the physical properties of these fermions will also be different in general from those of the bare electrons. Thus, the fermion mass will be renormalised by the effects of all fields which have been integrated out. The quasi-particle mass, as we have noted, arises from the final level of renormalisation, when all influences, including those arising within our window, are taken into account. At least near the critical point <span class="math inline">\(\left(T_{ c } \rightarrow 0\right),\)</span> it is the interaction field which we retain explicitly in our model that is expected to produce the dominant renormalisation of the quasi-particle properties. As shown below, the singularities in the latter in fact arise from the infrared components of the field (i.e. those in the low <span class="math inline">\(q, \omega\)</span> limit) and hence are weakly dependent on our somewhat arbitrary cut-offs <span class="math inline">\(q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{ c }\)</span>.</p>
<p>The central task, as we have said, is to identify the dominant part of the interaction field. Our key assumption is that this can be described as an exchange field <span class="math inline">\(h_{ m }\)</span> which couples to the magnetic moment <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> (but not the velocity) of a fermion via a potential energy of the form <span class="math inline">\(-\mu \cdot h_{ m } .\)</span> In the simplest case, <span class="math inline">\(h_{ m }\)</span> is proportional to the local magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(m(r, t),\)</span> so that we may write <span class="math inline">\(h_{ m }=\lambda m,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the exchange field parameter (a phenomenological constant).</p>
<p>In a more general treatment, <span class="math inline">\(h_{ m }\)</span> would be a functional of <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> involving in lowest order a convolution of an exchange field function <span class="math inline">\(\lambda(r, t)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m(r, t) .\)</span> In next order we would retain an appropriate term cubic in <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. For a statistical treatment, the full interaction field must also include, in addition to the component which depends explicitly on <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> a randomly fluctuating part with zero mean. Near the critical point, however, the fluctuations in the overall exchange field are expected to follow closely those of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> itself.</p>
<p>We stress that the Fourier components of both <span class="math inline">\(h_{ m }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are finite in our model only for <span class="math inline">\(q&lt;q_{ c }\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega&lt;\omega_{ c } .\)</span> We also restrict ourselves to cubic lattices and to the normal state (i.e. a state in the absence of symmetry breaking transitions). Under these conditions, the filtered system will appear essentially homogeneous and isotropic.</p>
<h5 id="alternative-descriptions">Alternative descriptions</h5>
<p>The model outlined above, of fermions and the exchange field coupled to each other, will be referred to as description</p>
<ul>
<li>(I). If we filter out (i.e. integrate out) the exchange field, we arrive at a description</li>
<li><ol start="2" type="I">
<li>in which we have fermions alone coupled to each other via a retarded spin-spin interaction.

</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="I">
<li>in which we imagine filtering out the fermions (i.e. integrating out the fermion field). This leads us to a picture of a fluctuating anharmonic field alone (Moriya 1985). In this way, we arrive at a framework analogous to that normally used in the study of critical phenomena which focuses on the statistical properties of fluctuations in an order parameter field. The difference is that for our problem it is not sufficient to treat the relevant field in a classical fashion.

</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>The limitation is that the itinerant character of the system, though implicitly included via the behaviour of the field, is not explicitly present in the model. For a description of the resistivity and pair instabilities, we must then generally return to descriptions (I) or (II). But even for calculations of these properties, description (III) is fruitful in providing a self-consistent model for the (final) way in which the field fluctuates or propagates. This model may then be used directly to determine the resistivity via an approach analogous to that used for electron-phonon scattering (Ziman 1960 ), and the pair instability via a generalisation of the <span class="math inline">\(BCS\)</span> theory (Schrieffer 1964 ).</p>
<p>Our technical discussion will initially focus on description (III) and hence on the statistical mechanics of the field. It is important to stress that the field does not form a closed system. It is coupled strongly to the fermions which have been filtered from view. Thus, the modes of the field are necessarily heavily damped and, indeed, over-damped in the non-magnetic state we shall consider. To deal with this problem, the normal theory of statistical mechanics must therefore be generalised. The key ingredients which will lead to a simplification of our treatment of the temperature dependences of the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity will be the fluctuation dissipation (Nyquist's) theorem and the related concept of the entropy of a dissipative mode of a system.</p>
<p>From the coupling of the field to the fermion moment <span class="math inline">\(\left(-\mu \cdot h_{ m }\right),\)</span> we may then develop models for the resistivity and pair instability. The key results of</p>
<p>this second stage of the programme will be summarised but not derived in full detail here.</p>
<p>As in the quantum theory of electromagnetism, the starting point in our discussion is the space and time behaviour of the interaction field. Since in the limit we shall consider the relevant interaction field is essentially always proportional to the local magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(m(r, t),\)</span> it will be sufficient to focus on the dynamics of the latter more physical variable.</p>
<h4 id="field-equation">6.3.2 Field equation</h4>
<p>In principle, the dynamics of the interaction field may be obtained by the formal method of integrating out essentially all other variables in the problem. This is, of course, impractical for real systems without the use of auxiliary assumptions, the validity of which is difficult to assess.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to postulate from the start, on the basis of empirical evidence and other constraints, the form of the field equation. From this intermediate starting point we may go 'forward' to determine the implications of the model for various observable properties, or else 'backward' towards a deeper understanding of the origin of the field equation and of its limitations in terms of a more microscopic model. The latter link between the microscopic and macroscopic levels clearly becomes more tenuous as we explore systems of increasing levels of complexity.</p>
<p>We will begin with an intermediate starting point and consider the implications for experimentally observable properties. Where possible, the known links to the more microscopic description will be indicated, but not developed explicitly. In this way, the phenomena discussed in sections 6.1 and 6.2 may be seen to arise in simple terms from a plausible common origin, namely the field equation for <span class="math inline">\(m ( r , t),\)</span> which will be developed below.</p>
<h5 id="static-scalar-field">Static scalar field</h5>
<p>For simplicity, we consider in this and the following sub-section, a scalar model of the field. Our goal is to obtain a plausible dynamical equation for the space and time dependence of the average magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(M(r, t)\)</span> in the presence of an applied magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(H(r, t) .\)</span> The latter is employed as a device for developing a model of the non-local magnetic susceptibility, which plays a central role in our discussions.</p>
<p>Consider first the simplest case of a uniform static field <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> which stabilises a uniform magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> given by some relation <span class="math inline">\(H=H(M) .\)</span> This function must be odd in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> for our isotropic system. Assuming that a Taylor expansion is possible, we then have, in the absence of the feedback effect of the exchange field, <span class="math inline">\(H=a_{0} M+b_{0} M^{3},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}\)</span> is the inverse of the Pauli susceptibility and <span class="math inline">\(b_{0}\)</span> is the anharmonicity parameter. We now include the effect of the exchange field by adding to <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> the effective field <span class="math inline">\(\lambda M .\)</span> This yields <span class="math inline">\(H(M)=a M+b M^{3}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a=a_{0}-\lambda\)</span> is the inverse of the enhanced susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(a&gt;0,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(b_{0}\)</span> if the exchange field is strictly linear in <span class="math inline">\(M .\)</span> We assume <span class="math inline">\(b&gt;0,\)</span> so that when <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;0\)</span> the spontaneous magnetisation is finite and vanishes continuously as <span class="math inline">\(a \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> For systems in which <span class="math inline">\(b&lt;0,\)</span> higher-order terms must be retained to describe an ordered state. The extension of our treatment to the latter case, which can exhibit transitions of the first kind, will be briefly discussed in the final sub-sections.</p>
<p>With this background for orientation, we now turn to the case of a spatially varying but still static field <span class="math inline">\(H(r)\)</span> which stabilises <span class="math inline">\(M(r) .\)</span> We drop explicit reference to <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and write <span class="math inline">\(H=H[M]\)</span>, where the square brackets now imply a mapping of one function of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to another. Now <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> depends not only on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> but also in general on the spatial gradient of <span class="math inline">\(M .\)</span> For an analytic function in an isotropic and homogeneous system, only even gradients enter, so that in a minimal extension of the uniform model (Landau and Lifshitz 1980 ) <span class="math display">\[
H=H[M]=a M+b M^{3}-c \nabla^{2} M
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a new parameter which measures the resistance of the system against spatial modulations in <span class="math inline">\(M .\)</span> For stability of a ferromagnetic (rather than an antiferromagnetic) phase, we require <span class="math inline">\(c&gt;0 .\)</span> Note that <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(c_{0},\)</span> the stiffness for the non-interacting fermions, only if the exchange field itself is independent of <span class="math inline">\(\nabla^{2} M\)</span> It will be useful in the following to introduce an effective field <span class="math display">\[
H_{ eff }=H-H[M]
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is the applied field and <span class="math inline">\(H[M]\)</span> is the right-hand side of eq. (1). <span class="math inline">\(H_{\text {eff }}\)</span> vanishes in the equilibrium state when eq. ( 1 ) is satisfied.</p>
<h5 id="scalar-dynamical-field">Scalar dynamical field</h5>
<p>We next turn to the time evolution of the magnetisation. In the paramagnetic state, we expect <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to relax towards equilibrium given by <span class="math inline">\(H_{ eff }=0 .\)</span> Thus, we assume that for small <span class="math inline">\(H_{ eff }\)</span> and slow variations <span class="math display">\[
\dot{M}=\gamma * H_{ eff }
\]</span> where and <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span> denote time derivative and spatial convolution, respectively, and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma( r )\)</span> is a relaxation function to be described below. Note eqs. ( 1<span class="math inline">\()-(3)\)</span> imply that, for <span class="math inline">\(H=0\)</span> and in leading order in <span class="math inline">\(M,\)</span> a Fourier component of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> relaxes to zero exponentially in time.</p>
<p>To simplify our treatment we decompose the field in a Fourier series as <span class="math display">\[
\chi( \rho )=\frac{1}{\Omega^{1 / 2}} \sum_{k} \chi_{k} e ^{ i k \cdot \rho}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\rho=(r, t), k=(q, \omega), k \cdot \rho=q \cdot r-\omega t,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is the product of the volume and a long time interval in which the expansion is performed. In the limit of large <span class="math inline">\(\Omega,\)</span> the sum goes over to an integral of the usual form <span class="math inline">\(\Omega \int d ^{d+1} k /(2 \pi)^{d+1},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the spatial dimension. In terms of Fourier components, the content of eqs. (1)-(3) in leading order in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> can be expressed as <span class="math display">\[
H_{k}=\chi_{k}^{-1} M_{k}
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\chi_{k}^{-1} &amp;=\chi_{q}^{-1}\left(1- i \frac{\omega}{\Gamma_{q}}\right) \\
\chi_{q}^{-1} &amp;=\chi^{-1}+c q^{2}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[
\Gamma_{q}=\gamma_{q} \chi_{k}^{-1}
\]</span> Note that the anharmonic term in eq. (1), which does not simplify in terms of Fourier components, is not explicitly given above. The quantity <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{k}\)</span> is the generalised linear susceptibility, defined as the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(M_{k}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(H_{k}\)</span> in analogy to the uniform case. It will be of central importance throughout. When <span class="math inline">\(\omega \rightarrow 0, \chi_{k}\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{q},\)</span> the static wave-vector-dependent susceptibility, which goes to <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(q \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> In the more complete analysis given below, the form of eqs. (5a)(5d) will survive, but <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> will no longer simply be the difference between the inverse Pauli susceptibility and the bare exchange constant.</p>
<p>The spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> which plays the key role in our discussions, may be interpreted as the rate at which a component <span class="math inline">\(M_{q}(t)\)</span> will relax to equilibrium for <span class="math inline">\(H=0 .\)</span> It depends on the inverse susceptibility and on <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{q},\)</span> the Fourier component of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(r)\)</span> defined as in eq. (4) but with the factor <span class="math inline">\(1 / \Omega^{1 / 2}\)</span> omitted. If the exchange field is independent of <span class="math inline">\(\dot{M},\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{q}\)</span> depends only on the properties of the non-interacting fermions and has low <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> form <span class="math display">\[
\gamma_{ q }=\gamma q^{n}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a constant and <span class="math inline">\(n,\)</span> as we argue below, is normally unity.</p>
<p>To understand the latter result, let us consider the way in which a disturbance of wavelength <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi / q\)</span> would tend to relax in the absence of an external field. In a homogeneous non-interacting Fermi system, relaxation proceeds via the ballistic motion of fermions moving typically at the Fermi velocity. Hence, decay takes place in a time proportional to wavelength, which implies <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q} \propto q\)</span>. Thus, from eq. (5d) we find <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>This linear relaxation at low <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> known as Landau damping (Baym and Pethick 1991 ), survives in a Fermi liquid even in the presence of the interaction field which is assumed to alter <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{q},\)</span> but not <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{q}\)</span> itself. In this case <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> is quite generally proportional to <span class="math inline">\(q \chi_{q}^{-1} .\)</span> The last factor correctly reflects the fact that as we approach the critical point the fluctuations at the critical wave vector tend to freeze. This slowing down of fluctuations is a general property of phase transitions of the second kind.</p>
<p>The assumption of ballistic motion of the fermions, and, in the Landau theory, of the quasi-particles themselves at the Fermi level, breaks down at low <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in the presence of frozen-in disorder or of thermal excitations at finite <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. For wavelengths <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi / q\)</span> much greater than the carrier mean free path, we expect diffusive rather than ballistic motion and hence a relaxation time proportional to the wavelength squared. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q} \propto q^{2}\)</span> at small <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> which implies <span class="math inline">\(n=2\)</span></p>
<p>The above argument assumes that scattering does not flip the spin locally but merely slows down the transport of spin by the fermions. In the presence of mechanisms which lead to local decay of the magnetisation, we may then have a non-vanishing <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> even as <span class="math inline">\(q \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> In this case, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is then essentially zero.</p>
<p>The experimental evidence suggests that for d-metals with weak spin-orbit interaction, a model with a single relaxation process at low <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span> proves adequate (Ishikawa et al. <span class="math inline">\(1985 ;\)</span> Bernhoeft et al. <span class="math inline">\(1989 ;\)</span> Lonzarich <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. 1989 ). However, for the f-metals with strong spin-orbit forces, two or more processes may be required for a minimal description of low-temperature properties (Bernhoeft and Lonzarich 1995 ).</p>
<h5 id="vector-dynamic-field">Vector dynamic field</h5>
<p>Thus far the magnetisation has been treated as a scalar. This is adequate for an isotropic system in the paramagnetic state in the linear regime, i.e. for small <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(H \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> But to investigate effects of the random field in the statistical treatment of the next section, we need to go beyond the harmonic model for the dynamics of a vector <span class="math inline">\(M .\)</span> This leads us to consider two types of non-linear terms. The first, already present in the scalar model, is the cubic term in eq. (1) which we now write in a slightly more general vector form <span class="math inline">\(M(M \cdot M)\)</span> in the vector extension <span class="math inline">\(H[M]\)</span> of eq. (1)</p>
<p>The second form of anharmonicity (present in the vector model alone) arises from the fact that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> will precess about some effective field <span class="math inline">\(H_{ eff }^{\prime},\)</span> a part of which depends on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> itself. <span class="math inline">\(\dot{ M }\)</span> will vanish as required in equilibrium if we take <span class="math inline">\(H_{ eff }^{\prime}=H_{ eff }\)</span> given by the vector extension of eq. (2). We are thus led to postulate a vector generalisation of eq. (3) <span class="math display">\[
\dot{ M }=\zeta\left( M \times H _{ eff }\right)+\gamma * H _{ eff }
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(H_{ eff }=H-H[M]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\zeta\)</span> is an appropriate gyroscopic ratio. Since <span class="math inline">\(M \times M=0,\)</span> we may replace <span class="math inline">\(H_{ eff }\)</span> in the cross-product in eq. (6) by <span class="math inline">\(H+\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(c \nabla^{2} M,\)</span> an effective field which also appears in the Landau-Lifshitz model for a ferromagnet with a local magnetisation of fixed amplitude and in the absence of damping (Herring <span class="math inline">\(1966 ;\)</span> Lifshitz and Pitaevskii 1980 ).</p>
<p>For a paramagnet, it follows from the fact that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> vanishes as <span class="math inline">\(H \rightarrow 0\)</span> that the precession term in eq. (6) is strictly non-linear in <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Thus, to leading order each component of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is correctly described, as expected, by our original scalar model (3). Non-linear precession, however, will be important in the presence of some additional field (e.g. a uniform component on top of a modulation) and, as we have said, in the analysis of the effect of the random field (see section <span class="math inline">\(6.3 .4)\)</span></p>
<p>We arrive then at a dynamical non-local model which describes precession, decay and two types of anharmonicity. The parameters of the model <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c, \gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\zeta\)</span> are phenomenological constants. If the exchange field is strictly proportional to <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> then only <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> differs from that of the non-interacting fermions. The parameters apart from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> may then be read off by comparing the prediction of eq. (6) for the generalised susceptibility with the known Lindhard function, i.e. the generalised susceptibility for non-interacting fermions* (Moriya 1985). This comparison also provides us with a first-principle justification of eq. (6), which we have introduced on physical grounds.</p>
<p>The microscopic evaluation of the remaining parameter <span class="math inline">\(a\left(=a_{0}-\lambda\right)\)</span> is made difficult by the fact that, near the critical point, it is the difference of two almost equal numbers. Thus, in contrast to the other quantities, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is very sensitive to small corrections. Of particular interest are corrections due to thermal excitations, which we attempt to describe in terms of temperature-independent parameters and a universal thermal function. The dominant effect comes not from the Fermi function defining the parameters of the non-interacting fermions (e.g. the Pauli susceptibility), but rather the Bose function which describes the amplitude of spontaneous fluctuations in the local magnetisation. The way in which these fluctuations affect the thermal properties in general will be the subject of sections 6.3 .3 and 6.3 .4 .</p>

<h5 id="quantisation">Quantisation</h5>
<p>The field equation (6) may be taken as a classical starting point for a quantum description. The quantisation of the field proceeds along one of two routes. The better known is the canonical, or operator, method, in which quantisation emerges from the discreteness of the eigensolutions. The second is the path integral technique, which involves an extension of stochastic theory to deal essentially with complex weights for configurations. In this approach, quantisation arises out of interference between alternative configurations.</p>
<p>The results given in the remainder of this chapter may be developed via the latter method by introducing an action whose stationary solution yields the field equation (6). Here we attempt to arrive at the same conclusions via more elementary arguments based on analogies to known results for the statistical mechanics of a quantum oscillator with dissipation. Fluctuation dissipation theorem We begin with a brief review of the statistical properties of an oscillator with a linear response function defined as <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{w}=x_{\omega} / f_{\omega},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the amplitude and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the external force. From the standard equation of motion of a simple damped oscillator, we find <span class="math display">\[
\alpha_{\omega}^{-1}=\alpha^{-1}\left(1-\frac{i \omega}{\Gamma}-\frac{\omega^{2}}{\Omega^{2}}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the static response function, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is the free resonance frequency and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> describes damping. In the zero damping limit, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma / \Omega \rightarrow \infty,\)</span> the imaginary part <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Im} \alpha_{\omega}\)</span> reduces to two delta functions centred on <span class="math inline">\(\pm \Omega\)</span> with weights 土<span class="math inline">\(\Omega / 2 .\)</span> From the well known mean energy of an oscillator, we may then express the variance of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as an integral over frequency in the form <span class="math display">\[
\overline{x^{2}}=\frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} d \omega\left(\frac{1}{2}+n_{\omega}\right) \operatorname{lm} \alpha_{\omega}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n_{\omega}=\left( e ^{\omega / T}-1\right)^{-1}\)</span> is the Bose function. We adopt a system of units in which <span class="math inline">\(\hbar=k_{ B }=1\)</span> throughout. This simply means that energy, frequency and temperature are measured in the same way (e.g. in milli-electron-volts). It is clear from <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Im} \alpha_{\omega},\)</span> with zero damping that eq. (8) does indeed yield the expected results <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^{-1} \overline{x^{2}}=\left((1 / 2)+n_{\Omega}\right) \Omega\)</span> for the thermal energy of a quantum oscillator at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. The first term is the zero point contribution. The second is the thermal part, which is a consequence of quantisation followed by averaging over an ensemble at finite <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span></p>
<p>The last result for the variance of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (in terms of <span class="math inline">\(n_{\Omega}\)</span> ) holds only for zero damping. But eq. (8) is completely general. It holds not only for eq. (7) but also for an arbitrary linear response function and in the presence of anharmonicities. This universal result is known as the fluctuation dissipation (Nyquist's) theorem (Landau and Lifshitz 1980 ), which is well known in connection with the related problem of Johnson noise. It provides us with a direct way of quantising the field at a level sufficient for our discussion of the variance of <span class="math inline">\(m ,\)</span> and hence of the temperature dependence of the susceptibility.</p>
<h5 id="thermal-population-for-over-damped-modes">Thermal population for over-damped modes</h5>
<p>We are interested in a susceptibility of the form of eq. (5b) which corresponds to eq. (7) in the extreme over-damping limit <span class="math inline">\(\Omega / \Gamma \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. In this case, it proves useful to introduce a dimensionless thermal population defined as <span class="math inline">\(n(\Gamma / T)=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\overline{x_{ T }^{2}} / \Gamma \alpha,\)</span> where the subscript <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> denotes the thermal part (i.e. the second term on the right-hand side of eq. ( 8 ) ). From eq. (7) in this limit together with eq. (8) we find <span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
n(\Gamma / T) &amp;=\frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} d \omega n_{\omega} \frac{\omega}{\omega^{2}+\Gamma^{2}} \\
&amp; \cong \frac{T}{\Gamma(1+(3 \Gamma / \pi T))}
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Note that the low- and high- <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> limits of <span class="math inline">\(n(\Gamma / T)\)</span> are, respectively, <span class="math inline">\((\pi / 3) T^{2} / \Gamma^{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T / \Gamma .\)</span> It is interesting to compare this with the corresponding limits of the thermal population for an undamped oscillator of frequency <span class="math inline">\(\Omega,\)</span> given by the Bose function as <span class="math inline">\(\exp (-\Omega / T)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T / \Omega,\)</span> respectively. We see that the high- <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> limits are of the same qualitative form. But at low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, in place of an exponential freezing out of the population, we find, for the over-damped limit, a more gradual quadratic temperature dependence. The form of <span class="math inline">\(n(\Gamma / T)\)</span> will play a crucial role in our discussion of the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid exponents in section 6.4</p>
<h5 id="entropy-of-dissipative-modes">Entropy of dissipative modes</h5>
<p>For a discussion of the heat capacity, we shall also need to generalise the concept of the entropy of an oscillator to include the effects of damping. We begin with a closed system consisting of an oscillator coupled to a reservoir. For sufficiently strong coupling, the standard treatment of the oscillator as a well defined normal mode breaks down. Nevertheless, the shift of the entropy of the closed system as a whole due to this coupling may be calculated in principle using conventional statistical mechanics. We now define the entropy of the damped oscillator to include this shift as if it were entirely the property of the oscillator itself, and attempt to express it in terms of the final oscillator response function <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\omega}\)</span> (Lonzarich <span class="math inline">\(1986 ;\)</span> Pippard <span class="math inline">\(1987 ;\)</span> Edwards and Lonzarich 1992 ). The required generalisation for the entropy is found to be <span class="math display">\[
S=\int_{0}^{\infty} d \omega S_{\omega}\left(\operatorname{Im} \frac{\partial \ln \alpha_{\omega}}{\pi \partial \omega}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S_{\omega}\)</span> is the usual entropy of an undamped oscillator of frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega .\)</span> The latter may be obtained from <span class="math inline">\(n_{\omega}\)</span> via the relation <span class="math inline">\(T \partial S_{\omega} / \partial T=\omega \partial n_{\omega} / \partial T\)</span></p>
<p>To gain some understanding of this result, let us consider a model in which the average potential and kinetic energies are <span class="math inline">\(\overline{x^{2}} / 2 \alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\dot{x}^{2}} / 2 \alpha \Omega^{2},\)</span> respectively. From Nyquist's theorem applied to both <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dot{x}\)</span>, we arrive at a thermal energy given by <span class="math inline">\((1 / 2 \alpha)\)</span> times the right-hand side of eq. ( 8 ), but with a factor <span class="math inline">\(\left(1+\left(\omega^{2} / \Omega^{2}\right)\right)\)</span> in the integral. It is now straightforward to show that this thermal energy yields an entropy of the form (10) for a (temperature-independent) <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\omega}\)</span> given by eq. (7). The result for <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is more general than this analysis would suggest. In particular, eq. ( 10 ) holds for an arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\omega} .\)</span> But, in contrast to Nyquist's theorem, it may be limited to low temperatures except, as discussed in section <span class="math inline">\(6.3 .4,\)</span> when the mean field approximation is appropriate. The last factor in eq. ( 10 ) reduces to <span class="math inline">\(\delta(\omega-\Omega)\)</span> for no damping <span class="math inline">\((\Gamma / \Omega \rightarrow \infty)\)</span> and to <span class="math inline">\((\Gamma / \pi) /\left(\omega^{2}+\Gamma^{2}\right)\)</span> in the opposite limit of over-damping, when only the lowest imaginary pole of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{\omega}\)</span> in eq. (7) is retained. The Lorentzian form is quite natural and reflects the spectral composition of an amplitude which does not oscillate, but decays exponentially with a rate <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma .\)</span> since only the low-frequency pole is retained, the integrated weight is here <span class="math inline">\(1 / 2\)</span> and not unity. Also, we note that the contribution of the <span class="math inline">\(\omega^{2} / \Omega^{2}\)</span> term discussed above vanishes in this limit, so that the energy is now essentially purely potential.</p>
<h5 id="heat-capacity-of-over-damped-modes">Heat capacity of over-damped modes</h5>
<p>For the problem of interest here, in which the relevant oscillator modes are strongly damped, the heat capacity <span class="math inline">\(C=T \partial S / \partial T\)</span> takes a particularly simple form: <span class="math display">\[
C=\frac{\Gamma}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial T} n\left(\frac{\Gamma}{T}\right)
\]</span> This follows directly from eq. ( 7 ) for <span class="math inline">\(a_{\omega}\)</span> in the limit <span class="math inline">\(\Omega / \Gamma \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, eq. ( 10 ) for <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and eq. (9a) for the thermal population. We note that eq. ( 11 ) holds under these conditions even if <span class="math inline">\(\partial \Gamma / \partial T\)</span> is non-zero.</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare eq. ( 11 ) with the corresponding heat capacity for an undamped oscillator of frequency <span class="math inline">\(\Omega,\)</span> namely <span class="math inline">\(C=\Omega \partial n_{\Omega} / \partial T .\)</span> The latter gives <span class="math inline">\(C=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C=\left(\Omega^{2} / T^{2}\right) \exp (-\Omega / T)\)</span> in the high- and low-temperature limits, respectively; while eqs. ( 11 ) and (9) yield, for the same limits, <span class="math inline">\(1 / 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((\pi / 3) T / \Gamma,\)</span> respectively. The difference at high <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> arises from the fact that an over-damped oscillator, as we have said, has only potential energy. At low temperatures, instead of an exponential collapse of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> we find, in the overdamped limit, a linear heat capacity. The latter will be related in section 6.4 to the renormalisation of the quasi-particle mass in the Fermi liquid state.</p>
<h4 id="mean-field-approximation-for-the-mode-mode-coupling">6.3.4 Mean field approximation for the mode-mode coupling</h4>
<p>With the above background for the statistical mechanics of a dissipative mode, we are now ready to deal with the exchange field, which, as we have stressed, corresponds to an open system strongly coupled to a reservoir, i.e. the fermions are now filtered from view. We think of each Fourier component of this field as an oscillator variable, or mode. Each mode, labelled by a cartesian component <span class="math inline">\((x, y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(z)\)</span> and the wave vector <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> is coupled not only to the reservoir, but also to other modes of the field. The latter, or the mode-mode coupling, arises in the model through the anharmonic terms in the field equation (6)</p>
<p>Our basic strategy is to deal with the coupling to the bath via the formalism developed in the preceding section for dissipative modes, and the coupling between modes themselves by the mean field approximation. The latter assumes that (i) the modes are statistically independent and that (ii) the characteristic energy (in our case <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> eq. <span class="math inline">\(\left.(5 d )\right)\)</span> for any one mode depends on the thermal population <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}=n\left(\Gamma_{q} / T\right)\)</span> of all other modes <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in a self-consistent fashion. since each mode includes corrections due to interaction with the others, the thermal energy of the field is not additive. But because of assumed statistical independence, the entropy itself is additive and is thus more convenient to use than the thermal energy. This is the chief reason for our focus on the entropy in the preceding section.</p>
<p>Thus, we arrive at a picture of a collection of independent dissipative modes described by a relaxation spectrum which depends, in the mean field approximation for the effect of anharmonicities, on the thermal population. since the latter also depends on the spectrum, we are led to a self-consistent equation for the temperature variation of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> and hence of the thermal properties, in terms of the <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> parameters alone.</p>
<p>We begin with a discussion of the heat capacity, assuming <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> is known at each <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> and only later consider how the temperature dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> may be determined from the anharmonicities built into the field equation. Finally, we shall consider the validity of the mean field approximation itself.</p>
<h5 id="heat-capacity">Heat capacity</h5>
<p>If the modes of the field can be treated as statistically independent in the above sense, then the entropy of the field reduces to the sum of contributions of the form ( 10 ). In the limit of strong dissipation, we then obtain from eq. ( 11 ) a heat capacity <span class="math display">\[
\Delta C=\frac{3}{2} \sum_{q} \Gamma_{q} \frac{\partial n_{q}}{\partial T}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> are the spectrum and population given, respectively, by eqs. (5) and (9). The factor of 3 in eq. (12) represents the degeneracy for each <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, i.e. the three cartesian components for the field, assumed to be equivalent throughout. since <span class="math inline">\(n\left(\Gamma_{q} / T\right)\)</span> varies as <span class="math inline">\(T^{2} / \Gamma_{q}^{2}\)</span> in the low- <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> limit, eq. ( 12 ) seems to lead to a shift in the linear heat capacity by an amount proportional to the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space average of <span class="math inline">\(1 / \Gamma_{q} .\)</span> In this case, interactions do not alter the qualitative temperature dependence of the system in lowest order in <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> but lead only to a renormalisation of the linear coefficient.</p>
<p>This analysis is clearly incomplete. We have ignored the temperature dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> and the fact that, for any finite <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> there may exist a range in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> at small <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> for which the assumption <span class="math inline">\(T \ll \Gamma_{q}\)</span> breaks down. As we shall see in section <span class="math inline">\(6.4,\)</span> the latter in particular can lead to anomalous corrections to the linear heat capacity which have no counterpart in the non-interacting electron system, and in extreme cases can also give rise to a leading temperature dependence which is qualitatively different from that of the conventional Fermi liquid. since these are associated with the low- <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> behaviour of the sum in eq.(12), they may be called infrared anomalies.</p>
<h5 id="non-linear-effects-of-the-exchange-field">Non-linear effects of the exchange field</h5>
<p>We now turn to the more difficult task of evaluating the temperature dependence of the spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> or, in particular, of the most sensitive variable in <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> namely the susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>.</p>
<p>In our treatment in section <span class="math inline">\(6.3 .2,\)</span> we have taken into account that part of the exchange field which follows the average <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the presence of <span class="math inline">\(H .\)</span> There also exists a spontaneous stochastic component with zero mean which drives random fluctuations in the local magnetisation. In the absence of anharmonicities, this additional field would have no consequences for the ensemble average of the field equation, and the results of section 6.3 .2 would remain unchanged. But this is not the case in the presence of terms non-linear in the magnetisation, which appear in eq. (6) both via precession and damping.</p>
<p>To see what can happen, let us look first at the static field equation (1). In the presence of a random exchange field <span class="math inline">\(h,\)</span> we may make the substitution <span class="math inline">\(H \rightarrow H+h\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow M+m,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the additional component induced by <span class="math inline">\(h .\)</span> Taking an ensemble average with <span class="math inline">\(\bar{h}=\bar{m}=0,\)</span> we see that only the cubic term <span class="math inline">\((M+m)^{3}\)</span> gives a non-vanishing contribution through the averages <span class="math inline">\(3 b M \overline{m^{2}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \overline{m^{3}}\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{m^{2}}\)</span> is finite even as <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow 0,\)</span> while <span class="math inline">\(\overline{m^{3}}\)</span> must vanish in this limit.</p>
<p>In general, these moments lead to corrections to all terms in <span class="math inline">\(H[M] .\)</span> In the mean field approximation, only the second moment as <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow 0\)</span> is retained. This then leads to a shift of the sensitive linear term in <span class="math inline">\(H[M]\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(a+3 b \overline{m^{2}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The same statistical analysis may now be carried out for the vector model, which includes a second independent type of anharmonicity, i.e. non-linear precession. The averaging over the random field is facilitated by first inverting eq. (6) to express <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(M, \nabla^{2} M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dot{M}\)</span>. This is achieved by taking the cross-product of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with each side of eq. (6), rearranging and dropping terms beyond second order in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the cross-product. Making the substitutions <span class="math inline">\(H \rightarrow H + h\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow M + m ,\)</span> and averaging with <span class="math inline">\(\overline{ h }=\overline{ m }=0,\)</span> we then find that the coefficients of the linear and cubic terms in <span class="math inline">\(H[M]\)</span> are now replaced by <span class="math inline">\(a+\Delta a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b+\Delta b,\)</span> where and <span class="math display">\[
\Delta a=\frac{5}{3}\left(b+\frac{\Delta b}{2}\right) \overline{|m|^{2}}-\zeta \gamma^{-2} * \nabla_{M} \overline{m \times \dot{m}}
\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[
\Delta b=\frac{14}{3} g \overline{| m |^{2}}
\]</span> As in the scalar model, the <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> dependences of the moments of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are not retained. The shift in <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> arises qualitatively from the same origin as the earlier shift in <span class="math inline">\(a,\)</span> but now from a fifth-order term in <span class="math inline">\(H[M]\)</span> of the form <span class="math inline">\(g M(M \cdot M)^{2}\)</span> The latter must be retained when <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is negative or, as in the case of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> itself, nearly critical. The only qualitatively new term is the last one in eq. (13a) due to non-linear precession. Here <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^{-1} *\)</span> is the inverse of the operation <span class="math inline">\(\gamma *\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{M}\)</span> denotes a gradient in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the limit <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> We retain the first gradient because it leads to corrections of the same order in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> as that of the mean field approximation.</p>
<p>The precession correction (the last term in <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> ) is strictly negative and grows in magnitude with increasing <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. This is in contrast with the first term, whose sign depends on <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, which can be positive or negative depending, for example, on the form of the density of states of non-interacting fermions at the Fermi level. It is interesting that thermal fluctuations in the presence of non-linear precession alone tend to promote rather than to destroy magnetic order, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> in the paramagnetic state would in this case grow rather than fall with increasing <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Eventually, the effects of more conventional anharmonicities in <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> (e.g. the <span class="math inline">\(|m|^{2}\)</span> term in eq. ( <span class="math inline">\(\left.13 a \right)\)</span> ) will dominate and lead to a downturn in <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> at high <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span></p>
<p>The ubiquitous peaks in <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> observed in nearly magnetic metals normally arise essentially from a negative <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> with positive higher-order coefficients such as <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in eq. <span class="math inline">\((13 b) .\)</span> But, as the above argument suggests, a peak can also arise if <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is positive but sufficiently small for the precession correction in <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> to dominate at low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. We note, however, that for fermions with a simple parabolic spectrum, we expect the first term in eq. (13a) to be positive and entirely dominant over the precession correction (Ramakrishnan <span class="math inline">\(1974 ;\)</span> McMullan 1989 ).</p>
<h5 id="susceptibility">Susceptibility</h5>
<p>For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the <span class="math inline">\(\overline{|m|^{2}}\)</span> term in eq. (13a), which defines the mean field approximation for the susceptibility. Our goal is to express this in terms of the population <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> parameters alone. We note that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{|m|^{2}}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space sum per unit volume of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\left|m_{q}\right|^{2}}\)</span> and that the latter is given via Nyquist's theorem (8) in terms of the generalised susceptibility in eq. (5). The thermal component of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{|m|^{2}}\)</span> is now seen to be explicitly a function of <span class="math inline">\(n_{q},\)</span> eq. (9), while the zero point part is implicitly a function of this quantity through the correction (13) to <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> which defines <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q} .\)</span> Our procedure is to expand the zero point part to first order in <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> and solve for <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> self-consistently.</p>
<p>In leading order in <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> the shift of <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> from its <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> value <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is then found to be <span class="math display">\[
\Delta a=5 b \hat{\sum_{q}} \gamma_{q} n_{q}=5 b  \hat{\sum_{q}} \gamma_{q} n\left(\frac{\gamma_{q}}{T}\left(a+\Delta a+c q^{2}\right)\right)
\]</span> where $ $ denotes a sum per unit volume. The <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are now as renormalised by the effects of zero point fluctuations (see also, e.g., Solontsov and Wagner 1995 ). From the explicit form of <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> (eq. (9)) and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> (eqs. <span class="math inline">\((5 d , e )),\)</span> we see that eq. (14) is an implicit equation for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a,\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1},\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and the basic parameters of the model <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span></p>
<p>We note that, since <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(T^{2} / \Gamma_{q}^{2}\)</span> at low <span class="math inline">\(T, \Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> might be expected to vary initially as <span class="math inline">\(T^{2} .\)</span> This corresponds to the normal Fermi liquid regime. since <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1} / T^{2}\)</span> depends on <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space averages of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{q} / \Gamma_{q}^{2},\)</span> it tends to be even more strongly enhanced as the critical point is approached than the linear heat capacity <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C / T,\)</span> which depends on an average of <span class="math inline">\(1 / \Gamma_{q} .\)</span> But as we shall see, sufficiently close to the critical point, where infrared fluctuations are important, the above qualitative temperature dependence will, in general, break down.</p>
<p>In summary, we have arrived at a simple model for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> which depends on the population <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> parameters. since <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> is a function of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> itself, we obtain a self-consistent equation, the solution of which yields the temperature dependence of the susceptibility and hence of the spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> From the latter we may then obtain <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> from eq. ( 12 ) and also, as shown in the next section, the electrical resistivity <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> of the fermions in leading order in perturbation theory.</p>
<h5 id="resistivity">Resistivity</h5>
<p>For an analysis of the electrical resistivity we now return to description (I), in which fermions interact with the exchange field via a potential <span class="math inline">\(-\mu \cdot \lambda m\)</span>. The rate of scattering of fermions with the field may be determined in perturbation theory, and the resistivity is then obtained by means of the Boltzmann transport equation, as in the case of phonon scattering (Moriya 1985 ).</p>
<p>A standard analysis in the Born approximation then leads to a resistivity, which may be expressed as <span class="math display">\[
\Delta \rho=\eta \sum_{q} q^{k}\left(\frac{T \partial n_{q}}{\partial T}\right)_{\Gamma}
\]</span> where normally <span class="math inline">\(k=2,\)</span> the suffix <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> denotes a derivative at constant <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> depends on the strength of the coupling between the fermions and the exchange field, which is essentially temperature independent at the level of approximation employed. <span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> This result has a plausible form. The factor in the brackets in eq. (15) is simply proportional to <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> in leading order in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and reflects the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> grows with increasing thermal disorder. On the other hand, the <span class="math inline">\(q^{2}\)</span> factor describes the fact that fluctuations of high <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> which produce scattering at large angles, should be more effective in reducing the current than those at low <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> that scatter fermions only at low angles. We note that eq. (15) is of the same form as for phonon scattering if by <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> we mean the Bose function evaluated at the phonon propagation frequency <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{q}\)</span></p>
<p>In leading order in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> we expect <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> to vary as <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> times a <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space average of <span class="math inline">\(q^{2} / \Gamma_{q}^{2}\)</span>. We see that, in the Fermi liquid regime, the quadratic coefficient is even more strongly enhanced than the linear coefficient of the heat capacity, which depends on an average of <span class="math inline">\(1 / \Gamma_{q}\)</span></p>
<p>The above analysis is, however, incomplete for the reasons given in our discussion of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span>. As we shall show in section <span class="math inline">\(6.4,\)</span> the Fermi liquid form of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> and that of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> can break down under certain conditions, which lead to the infrared anomalies.</p>
<h5 id="extensions-of-the-model">Extensions of the model</h5>
<p>For completeness, we also note that, when the anharmonicity parameter <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is small or negative, it may be necessary to retain the additional correction in eqs. (13a) and (13b) even at low temperatures. An analysis similar to that outlined above yields an expression for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> equivalent to eq. (14), but with the parameter <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in the right-hand side replaced by <span class="math inline">\(b+(\Delta b / 2),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta b\)</span> is now the shift of the cubic coefficient in <span class="math inline">\(H(M)\)</span> from its <span class="math inline">\(T=0\)</span> value, <span class="math display">\[
\Delta b=14 g \hat{\sum_{q}} \gamma_{q} n_{q}
\]</span> In the limit of small <span class="math inline">\(b,\)</span> we must also take account of the non-linear precession term in eq. (13a), the qualitative effects of which have already been discussed. Throughout, we have assumed that the number of equivalent field components for each <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is 3 . It is straightforward to generalise our analysis for an arbitrary number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. The result is that the numerical factors 3,5 and 14 in eqs.(12), (14) and (16) are replaced respectively, by <span class="math inline">\(N, 2+N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(8+2 N\)</span>. It is also useful to extend the results, where possible, to describe fluctuations which are nearly critical about some large wave vector <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> near the Brillouin zone boundary rather than, as we have assumed thus far, about the origin. In this case, we may shift origin in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space, <span class="math inline">\(q \rightarrow Q+q,\)</span> and continue to use the above model, but with the following minimal modifications (Moriya 1985 ). since in lowest order in <span class="math inline">\(q, \gamma_{Q+q} \cong \gamma_{Q}\)</span> is a finite constant, we may take <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to be zero in eq. (5e). Furthermore, since <span class="math inline">\(|Q+q|^{2}\)</span> is also a constant in leading order in <span class="math inline">\(q,\)</span> the exponent <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho,\)</span> eq. <span class="math inline">\((15),\)</span> similarly reduces to zero. Finally, the susceptibility and anharmonicity parameters, eqs. ( 14 ), ( 16 ), must now be considered to correspond to the anti-ferromagnetic magnetisation at wave vector <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. This extension to the case of incipient anti-ferromagnetism has not been tested experimentally as thoroughly as for the ferromagnetic counterpart. In particular, the range of validity of the model of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> is now more restricted than for the latter, and the assumptions in section 6.3 .2 on the analytical properties of the relevant magnetic equation of state may apply only to the simplest examples of conductors near anti-ferromagnetic instabilities (Hlubina and Rice 1995 ; Anderson <span class="math inline">\(1997 a\)</span> ).</p>
<h5 id="range-of-validity-of-the-mean-field-approximation---a-general-ginzburg-criterion">Range of validity of the mean field approximation - a general Ginzburg criterion</h5>
<p>We conclude our technical discussion with a brief examination of corrections to the mean field approximation for the mode-mode coupling. The key result is that the latter should break down qualitatively in a finite interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T_{ G }\)</span> near <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(d \leqslant 4 .\)</span> But this interval vanishes more rapidly than <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c } \rightarrow 0,\)</span> if the effective dimension <span class="math inline">\(d+z\)</span> exceeds <span class="math inline">\(4,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is the dynamical exponent. The latter gives the leading <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{ q } \propto q^{z}\)</span> near the critical point and for our model, eqs. <span class="math inline">\((5 d , e ),\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(2+n .\)</span> The conclusion is that when <span class="math inline">\(d+z&gt;4,\)</span> the mean field model is expected to be qualitatively correct for describing quantum critical phenomena (Hertz 1976; Millis 1993; Sachdev 1996) The effective dimension is now greater than the spatial dimension which enters the classical theory, because a quantum description must be based not on a free energy for a spatially varying variable, but rather on an action for an order parameter which depends on both space and an effective time (Tsvelik 1995). The contribution of the latter is, in general, not equivalent to that of a space dimension unless the dynamical exponent <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> which relates space and time in the spectrum is unity.</p>
<p>The first correction we wish to consider is the last term in eq. ( 13 ), which arises from non-linear precession. A calculation analogous to that given above shows that this correction has the same initial temperature dependence as that of the first term, and that, for a parabolic band model for the fermions, its magnitude is small and ignorable (McMullan 1989). As we have already discussed, however, non-linear precession can play an important role when the anharmonicity parameter <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is small.</p>
<p>The next correction arises from the dependence of the variance of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> on the average magnetisation <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. If we expand <span class="math inline">\(\overline{m^{2}}\)</span> in a power series in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the scalar model discussed earlier, we obtain a correction to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> of the form <span class="math inline">\(\Delta b=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(3 b \partial \overline{m^{2}} / \partial\left(M^{2}\right),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{m^{2}}\)</span> includes both zero point and thermal contributions, and the derivative is evaluated for <span class="math inline">\(M \rightarrow 0 .\)</span> The <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> dependence appears in <span class="math inline">\(\overline{m^{2}}\)</span> through the inverse susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\partial H / \partial M=a+3 b M^{2} .\)</span> From Nyquist's theorem and our model for <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{k}\)</span> (eq. (5)), we readily find <span class="math display">\[
\Delta b=-9 b^{2} \widehat{\sum}_{q} \gamma_{q} \chi_{q}[1-(x \partial n(x) / \partial x)]_{q}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x=\Gamma_{q} / T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n(x)\)</span> is the population function (9)</p>
<p>Consider first the immediate vicinity of a non-vanishing <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span>. The low-q modes satisfying <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q} \ll T_{ c }\)</span> may be treated in the classical limit <span class="math inline">\((n(x) \rightarrow 1 / x)\)</span> and hence they lead to a contribution to the right-hand side of eq. (17) proportional to a low- <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> sum of <span class="math inline">\(T \chi_{q}^{2} .\)</span> At <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c },\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{q}^{-1}\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(c q^{2},\)</span> it is clear that this sum is finite only when <span class="math inline">\(d&gt;4 .\)</span> For <span class="math inline">\(d \leqslant 4,\)</span> the correction to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is singular and, hence, the mean field model breaks down. A range in temperature <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T_{ G }\)</span> about <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c },\)</span> where a qualitative breakdown occurs, may be defined by the condition <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta b / b|&gt;1 .\)</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T_{ G } / T_{ C } \ll 1,\)</span> we find from eq. (17) and for <span class="math inline">\(d&lt;4\)</span> <span class="math display">\[
\Delta T_{ G } \sim\left(b^{2} T_{ c }^{2} / c^{d} u^{4-d}\right)^{\frac{1}{\pi^{4-d}}}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> are defined by <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}=u\left(T-T_{ c }\right)^{v}\)</span> in the breakdown region.</p>
<p>As <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c } \rightarrow 0,\)</span> the classical treatment above is no longer applicable. Returning to the more general result (17), we see that, in this limit <span class="math inline">\((n(x) \rightarrow 0), \Delta b\)</span> is nonsingular if <span class="math inline">\(d+z&gt;4 .\)</span> Thus, the mean field approximation is more stable in the quantum than in the classical limit. The improved stability arises from the contribution of the dynamics of the fluctuations, which effectively leads to the replacement of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in the classical limit of eq. ( 17 ) by <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span>. Thus, the sum of <span class="math inline">\(T \chi_{q}^{2}\)</span> which is singular for <span class="math inline">\(d \leqslant 4,\)</span> is replaced by a sum over <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q} \chi_{q}^{2}=\gamma_{q} \chi_{q},\)</span> which is singular only if <span class="math inline">\(d+z \leqslant 4\)</span></p>
<p>In conclusion, the mean field approximation for the mode-mode coupling is more stable for quantum than for classical phase transitions, and, in the absence of new instabilities, the predictions of the model discussed in the preceding section may be expected to be qualitatively correct in essentially all cases considered.</p>
<h2 id="predictions-and-comparisons-with-experiment">6.4 Predictions and comparisons with experiment</h2>
<p>In this final section, the predictions of the model developed in section 6.3 will be summarised and briefly compared with observations. The Fermi liquid limit of the model has already been mentioned, and our focus will be mainly on its breakdown, which, in the language of description (II), may be attributed either to the long range or to the attractive nature of the induced fermion-fermion interaction.</p>
<p>It is useful to summarise the key elements of the model which we shall need to carry with us in this section. The central quantity is the spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> (eqs. <span class="math inline">\((5 d , e )),\)</span> which defines the population <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}=n\left(\Gamma_{q} / T\right)( eq .(9)) .\)</span> From this and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{q},\)</span> we arrive at a self-consistent equation for the susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\chi,\)</span> eq. (14). The latter yields the temperature dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> and hence of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> (eq. (12)) and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho( eq \cdot(15)) .\)</span> The effective induced interaction between fermions, which we shall need explicitly to discuss the pair instability, can be shown to be given by the real part of the generalised susceptibility, equation (5), which is also fully determined by the above procedure.</p>
<h4 id="general-form-of-low-temperature-exponents">6.4 .1 General form of low-temperature exponents</h4>
<p>We consider first in a general way the prediction of the model for the temperature dependences in the low-temperature limit. In all cases, this is given by a <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> space average of the population <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> weighted by a <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -dependent factor of the form <span class="math inline">\(q^{m}\)</span> at low <span class="math inline">\(q .\)</span> Thus, for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho, m\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k,\)</span> respectively (see eqs. (5e), (14) and (15)). For <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span>, the low- <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> form of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> leads to a value of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> equal to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> away from the critical point, but to <span class="math inline">\(z=2+n\)</span> near the critical point when <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> can be essentially ignored.</p>
<p>From our expression for the population (9), we find that the required sum in <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> dimensions reduces to <span class="math display">\[
\sum_{q} q^{m} n_{q} \propto T^{s} \int_{0}^{x_{\varepsilon}} \frac{x^{s-2} d x}{1+x}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\((d+m) / n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\((d+m) / z,\)</span> respectively, for the above two limits of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_{ c }\)</span> is a cut-off inversely proportional to <span class="math inline">\(T .\)</span> This simple result describes in a compact way all of the predictions of the model for the asymptotic lowtemperature exponents for the susceptibility, heat capacity and resistivity in the paramagnetic state.</p>
<h4 id="the-fermi-liquid">6.4 .2 The Fermi liquid</h4>
<p>We consider first the most common limit <span class="math inline">\(s&gt;2,\)</span> which is normally appropriate for <span class="math inline">\(d&gt;2\)</span> well away from the critical point. In this case, the integral in eq. (19) is determined by the upper cut-off <span class="math inline">\(x_{ c } \propto 1 / T .\)</span> In leading order in <span class="math inline">\(T,\)</span> we see that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> drops out and eq. (19) reduces to the universal <span class="math inline">\(T^{2}\)</span> form which is independent of <span class="math inline">\(d, m\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(n .\)</span> This is the behaviour of <span class="math inline">\(T \Delta C, \Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> in the normal Fermi liquid description, which, as we have stressed, characterises the vast majority of conducting systems at low temperature, but above the temperature at which pairs are formed.</p>
<p>These temperature dependences are qualitatively the same as that for noninteracting or weakly interacting fermions. But the corrections to the linear heat capacity are in general not qualitatively the same as for non-interacting fermions. Thus, for <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> of the Landau damping form away from the critical point in three dimensions and with three components of <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> eqs. <span class="math inline">\((5 d , e ),(9)\)</span> and (12) yield <span class="math display">\[
\Delta C=\alpha T+\beta T^{3} \ln \left(T / T^{*}\right)+\cdots
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
\alpha=\pi \sum_{q}\left(1 / \Gamma_{q}\right)
\]</span> The second term in eq. (20a), which has no counterpart in a non-interacting system, arises from the behaviour of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> at low <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and is an example of an infrared anomaly discussed earlier. The existence of the <span class="math inline">\(T^{3} \ln \left(T / T^{*}\right)\)</span> term is well established for liquid <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3} He\)</span> in the normal state (Baym and Pethick 1991 ). But in metals the range of validity of this term can be small, and a comparison with experiment beyond leading order in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> normally requires a numerical integration of eq. (12). We note that, for our model, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=\ln \left(1+c \chi q_{ c }^{2}\right) / 4 \pi \gamma c, \beta=2 \pi \chi^{3} / 5 \gamma^{3},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T^{*}\)</span> is of the order of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma /\left(c \chi^{3}\right)^{1 / 2}\)</span>. If we substitute for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> the parameters appropriate for non-interacting fermions with a parabolic spectrum, we arrive, via a new route, precisely at the results of the paramagnon theory originally developed for the normal state of liquid <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He (Izuyama et al. <span class="math inline">\(1963 ;\)</span> Berk and Schrieffer 1966; Doniach and Engelsberg 1966; Béal-Monod et al. 1968; Brinkman and Engelsberg 1968 and others).</p>
<p>The coefficient of the first term in eq. (20a) is a measure of the enhancement of the quasi-particle mass due to the induced interaction associated with the exchange field in this model. We see that a heavy fermion state is favoured where <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> is small over a wide range in <span class="math inline">\(q .\)</span> For our form <span class="math inline">\((5 d )\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> this is expected near the instability where <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> is small and in systems where the stiffness <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is small. These conditions are met in some d-transition-metals which are both near the middle of the series and on the border of magnetic instabilities, and especially in many f-metals.</p>
<p>The above model for the linear coefficient has provided a quantitative description of heavy quasi-particle masses observed in the nearly magnetic dmetals (Lonzarich 1986 ). It may also offer a useful starting point for describing the more strongly renormalised masses in many f systems.</p>
<p>We have arrived at a model of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> via an unconventional route, namely description (III) of dissipative modes of the interaction field. It may seem from this viewpoint that our attribution of the excess linear term, eqs. <span class="math inline">\((20 a , b ),\)</span> to fermion quasi-particles has only a formal significance. However, it can be shown via descriptions (I) or (II) that the elementary excitations of the combined system of fermions and exchange field are indeed fermions again, but with a renormalised mass given by the starting mass plus a correction consistent with eqs. <span class="math inline">\((20 a , b )\)</span></p>
<p>Direct experimental evidence in support of the existence of such quasiparticles with extraordinarily high effective masses has been collected in the last decade in a number of d-metals (Taillefer et al. 1986 ) and f-metal heavy fermion compounds (see chapter <span class="math inline">\(8 ;\)</span> also Reinders et al. 1986; Taillefer and Lonzarich 1988 ; Aoki et al. 1993 and others).</p>
<p>In a few cases, these investigations, via quantum oscillatory phenomena in intense magnetic fields and very low temperatures, have established that the contribution to the linear heat capacity expected to arise from the quasi-particle system as a whole (Fulde et al. 1988 ) is indeed comparable to that actually observed in bulk heat capacity experiments (Julian <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. 1997a). These findings, together with theoretical analyses of the heat capacity via eq. (20) directly, have helped to confirm the consistency of results obtained from the different starting descriptions (I) to (III).</p>
<h4 id="non-fermi-liquids">6.4.3 Non-Fermi liquids</h4>
<p>Let us now return to the original <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> -space sum (19) and consider the opposite case where the exponent <span class="math inline">\(s \leqslant 2 .\)</span> In contrast to the results of the previous subsection, we now find that the upper cut-off <span class="math inline">\(x_{ c }\)</span> does not play the dominant role. The case <span class="math inline">\(s=2\)</span> is marginal and eq. (19) yields again a universal function, independent of <span class="math inline">\(d, n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m,\)</span> but now of the non-analytic form <span class="math inline">\(T^{2} \ln \left(T^{*} / T\right)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T^{*}\)</span> is a constant. For <span class="math inline">\(s&lt;2,\)</span> the relevant exponent is non-universal and falls below that of the usual Fermi liquid model. For <span class="math inline">\(1&lt;s&lt;2,\)</span> in particular, eq. ( 19 ) is well defined and varies as <span class="math inline">\(T^{y}\)</span> at low <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>The limit <span class="math inline">\(s&lt;2\)</span> may be satisfied in reduced dimensions in general or in three dimensions near a critical point where <span class="math inline">\(s=(d+m) / z, z=2+n .\)</span> Let us consider first the latter in the presence of Landau damping so that <span class="math inline">\(d=z=3\)</span>. From eq. (19), we may immediately infer that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C, \Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> have leading temperature dependences of the form <span class="math inline">\(T \ln \left(T^{*} / T\right), T^{4 / 3},\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T^{5 / 3},\)</span> respectively. This defines a state known as the marginal Fermi liquid. (The <span class="math inline">\(T^{5 / 3}\)</span> form for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> was first obtained by Mathon <span class="math inline">\((1968) .)\)</span> Note that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> has precisely the marginal value of 2 for <span class="math inline">\(T \Delta C,\)</span> which may be obtained from eq. (19) when we set <span class="math inline">\(m=z\)</span>. The latter limit has provided a useful framework for describing certain dmetals near ferromagnetic instabilities at low temperature (Pfleiderer et al. 1994,<span class="math inline">\(1995 ;\)</span> Grosche <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. <span class="math inline">\(1995 ;\)</span> Thessieu <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. 1995 ). The marginal Fermi liquid model has also appeared in theoretical treatments of the very weak, but long-range, Lorentz interaction of moving charges in an ideal conductor (Holstein <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. <span class="math inline">\(1973 ;\)</span> Reizer 1989 ). Furthermore, a state with the same <span class="math inline">\(T \ln \left(T^{*} / T\right)\)</span> form for the heat capacity has been introduced in the study of the normal state of the high-temperature superconductors (Varma et al. 1989 ).</p>
<p>The departure from the Fermi liquid form is even more extreme near a critical point in lower dimensions. Thus, for <span class="math inline">\(z=3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d=2,\)</span> eq. (19) yields <span class="math inline">\(T^{2 / 3}, T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T^{4 / 3},\)</span> respectively, for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C, \Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho .\)</span> These results for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> have also been obtained by a different technique for a two-dimensional system in which the critical fluctuations are not of the magnetisation, but of a higher-order object, known as a chiral field (Lee and Nagaosa 1992 )</p>
<p>We also consider briefly the implications of this model for the nearly antiferromagnetic metals discussed at the end of section 6.3 for which, effectively, <span class="math inline">\(n=k=0\)</span> (Moriya 1985). At the critical point, therefore, the dynamical exponent is <span class="math inline">\(z=2 .\)</span> In three dimensions, we find from eq. (19) that the heat capacity is linear in first order, as expected for a Fermi liquid. However, the linear coefficient can be very large, particularly when the stiffness <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is small, as in the heavy fermion <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> -metals. Furthermore, the correction to the leading term has the anomalous form <span class="math inline">\(T^{3 / 2}\)</span>. Thus, the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C / T\)</span> can show a marked upturn at low temperature, which, as numerical analyses suggest, can resemble, over a wide range in temperature, the divergence associated with a non-Fermi liquid state. We also note that both <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi_{Q}^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> are (from eq. (19)) now expected to have a <span class="math inline">\(T^{3 / 2}\)</span> temperature dependence, which differs from that of the usual Fermi liquid. <span class="math inline">\(^{\dagger}\)</span></p>
<p>We note that in all of the examples considered above the requirements <span class="math inline">\(d+z&gt;4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s&gt;1\)</span> are indeed satisfied. <span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> In lower dimensions, one or both of these may be violated and the treatment given here then breaks down. In a onedimensional conductor, this leads us to the Luttinger liquid state which lies outside of the present framework (Anderson <span class="math inline">\(1997 b\)</span> ).</p>
<h4 id="magnetic-instability">6.4 .4 Magnetic instability</h4>
<p>The great abundance of systems which appear to be on the border of longrange magnetic order, and for which therefore the models of the last section are relevant, is, at first sight, surprising. Part of the explanation lies in the role of the anharmonicities in the field equation, which, in the presence of zero point and thermal fluctuations, generally tend to suppress <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> below the value <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }^{0}\)</span> in the absence of either anharmonicities or fluctuations. In our model, <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }^{0}\)</span> is essentially given by the condition <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}-\lambda=0,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}\)</span> is the temperaturedependent inverse Pauli susceptibility of the non-interacting fermions. The final <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> is then given by <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}-\lambda+\Delta a=0,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> is the correction, eq. (13) which arises from the combined effect of anharmonicities and of spontaneous fluctuations. For sufficiently large fluctuations, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> is, in general, positive, and hence <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> is driven down below <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }^{0}\)</span></p>
<p>This suppression of <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> increases with decreasing dimension and with decreasing value of the stiffness <span class="math inline">\(c .\)</span> Among the low-dimensional systems, or in the heavy fermion f-metals where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is small, we therefore expect, and find, numerous examples of systems with low or vanishing magnetic critical points.</p>
<p>Even for three-dimensional d-metals, the reduction of the magnetic transition by fluctuations is very pronounced, and typically <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> is one or more orders of magnitude below <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }^{0}\)</span>. In such cases, where the temperature dependence of <span class="math inline">\(a_{0}\)</span> can be ignored, <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> may be obtained in our model by the condition <span class="math inline">\(a+\Delta a=0\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a constant and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta a\)</span> is given by eq. (14). From <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span> (eqs. ( <span class="math inline">\(\left.\left.5 d , e \right)\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{q}\)</span> (eq. (9)), we then find for <span class="math inline">\(d=3\)</span> and three equivalent components of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> are the basic parameters of the model and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is a pure number approximately equal to 2.39 for <span class="math inline">\(z=3\)</span> and 0.256 for <span class="math inline">\(z=2,\)</span> corresponding to the Curie and Néel transitions, respectively. This model has provided the starting point for our current understanding of magnetic transitions in conducting materials. For the low-temperature ferromagnets, it leads to predictions of <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> in close agreement with observation (Lonzarich 1984,1986 Lonzarich and Taillefer <span class="math inline">\(1985 ;\)</span> Takahashi and Moriya 1985 ).</p>
<p>The above treatment also allows us to determine the way in which <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> may depend on a control parameter such as pressure <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> about the critical <span class="math inline">\(p_{c},\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{ c }\)</span> vanish. A leading order expansion of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is expected to be linear in <span class="math inline">\(\left(p-p_{ c }\right),\)</span> so that, from eq. (19) with <span class="math inline">\(m=n,\)</span> we find <span class="math display">\[
T_{ c }^{(d+n) / z} \propto\left(p_{ c }-p\right)
\]</span> For <span class="math inline">\(n=1, d=z=3,\)</span> the exponent of <span class="math inline">\(4 / 3\)</span> in eq. (22) is consistent with observation in a d-metal ferromagnet with a continuous phase transition near <span class="math inline">\(p_{c}\)</span> (Grosche et al. 1995).</p>
<p>It is important to note that the above treatments assume that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is positive and not very small. When this is not the case, the analysis must be extended to take account of the effects of higher-order anharmonicities (eqs. (13), (16)). The problem is then considerably more complicated, and near <span class="math inline">\(p_{c}\)</span> the phase transition may cross over from second to first order (Yamada 1993 ; Pfleiderer et al. 1995 ).</p>
<p>Finally, we note that eq. (14) for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{-1}\)</span> also allows us to understand the ubiquitous linear temperature dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> at high <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in d-metals. For the normal case, <span class="math inline">\(n=1, d=z=3, \chi^{-1}\)</span> varies as <span class="math inline">\(T^{4 / 3}\)</span> just above <span class="math inline">\(T_{c} .\)</span> With increasing <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1},\)</span> and hence <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q},\)</span> the curve bends below <span class="math inline">\(T^{4 / 3}\)</span> and, as confirmed by self-consistent numerical analysis, tends to stabilise at a linear temperature dependence over a wide range (Murata and Doniach 1972; Moriya and Kawabata <span class="math inline">\(1973 a , b )\)</span></p>
<h4 id="spin-fluctuation-mediated-interaction">6.4.5 Spin fluctuation mediated interaction</h4>
<p>The magnetic instability discussed above arises when <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is negative. From a somewhat unconventional point of view, this instability is due to a tendency of particles and holes of opposite spins to attract and pair. When <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is positive, the latter repel, but now an attractive induced interaction can arise between particles or between holes of the appropriate relative spins. This pairing now drives a pure system at sufficiently low temperature towards a superconducting instability. Thus, the normal states described in earlier sections are not expected to be the true ground states of the model we are considering.</p>
<p>The way the induced interaction arises via the exchange field has already been discussed qualitatively. Let us now consider the form of this interaction more quantitatively. Our goal is to determine the potential energy <span class="math inline">\(v(r)\)</span> of a fermion at <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> due to another at the origin. This potential, however, arises from the exchange of fields which propagate slowly. Thus, we are led to consider a potential energy per unit time <span class="math inline">\(v( r , t)\)</span> of a first fermion at <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> due to a second at the origin in both space and time. The first experiences an interaction with the exchange field of the form <span class="math inline">\(v(r, t)=-\mu \cdot \lambda m(r, t)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> arises from an effective field <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> produced by the second via a convolution with the non-local susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\chi(r, t) .\)</span> Taking <span class="math inline">\(h=\lambda \mu^{\prime} \delta(r) \delta(t),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mu^{\prime}\)</span> is the moment of the second fermion, we then find <span class="math inline">\(v(r, t)=-\mu \cdot \mu^{\prime} \lambda^{2} \chi(r, t)\)</span> The final potential is the average of the latter plus the inverse process in which fermion 1 transmits an equivalent exchange field to fermion <span class="math inline">\(2 .^{*}\)</span> Thus we are led to a Fourier transform of <span class="math inline">\(v(r, t)\)</span> of the form <span class="math display">\[
v_{q \omega}=-\mu \cdot \mu^{\prime} \lambda^{2} \operatorname{Re} \chi_{\varphi \omega}
\]</span> where Re denotes the real part of <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{q \omega},\)</span> which is given by eq. (5).</p>
<p>We note that <span class="math inline">\(v_{q \omega}\)</span> is negative for particles of the same spin, and hence we might expect eq. (23) to lead only to pairing in the spin triplet state of necessarily odd parity. This conclusion is valid for our model (5) of a nearly ferromagnetic system <span class="math inline">\((c&gt;0),\)</span> for which the static non-local susceptibility <span class="math inline">\(\chi(r)\)</span> is everywhere positive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for an incipient anti-ferromagnet <span class="math inline">\((c&lt;0,\)</span> see below <span class="math inline">\(),\)</span> even where <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{q}\)</span> is everywhere positive, <span class="math inline">\(\chi(r)\)</span> oscillates and has a negative regime at small <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, which can favour the spin singlet state of even parity. It is interesting that, in this case, pairing can arise even when the transform (23) is everywhere greater than zero. A positive binding energy is achieved via the construction of an anisotropic pair wavefunction, which allows the particles to sample mainly the attractive regions of the space-time potential.</p>
<p>Also note that, for an adequate description of the latter, we now need to begin with a model for fermions and the exchange field which takes explicit account of the lattice. The potential now depends not only on the separation <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, but also on the coordinate <span class="math inline">\(r^{\prime}\)</span> of the second fermion. We may average over <span class="math inline">\(r^{\prime}\)</span> to obtain essentially <span class="math inline">\(v( r )\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\chi_{q}\)</span> as discussed above. In an extension of eq. (5), we replace expansions in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> by leading sinusoidal functions periodic in the crystalline lattice. For a simple cubic unit cell with side <span class="math inline">\(a, \chi_{q}^{-1}\)</span> in particular would then take the form <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{-1}+\left(2 c / a^{2}\right)\left(3-\cos q_{x} a-\cos q_{y} a-\cos q_{z} a\right) .\)</span> Incipient ferromagnetism and anti-ferromagnetism can now be described in essentially the same model with positive and negative values of <span class="math inline">\(c,\)</span> respectively.</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare the above potential (eqs. (5), (23)) with the more familiar case arising from the exchange of massive propagating bosons. For the latter, <span class="math inline">\(v_{q \omega}\)</span> is inversely proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\left(q^{2}+\kappa^{2}\right)\left(\omega^{2}-s^{2} q^{2}\right),\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the speed of propagation, <span class="math inline">\(\kappa^{2}\)</span> is a measure of mass and <span class="math inline">\(1 / \kappa\)</span> is the interaction range. We see from eqs. (5) and (23) that, in our problem, <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\((1 / c \chi)^{1 / 2}\)</span> and hence that the range, as already argued qualitatively, diverges at the critical point. It also follows from eqs. (5) and (23) that the frequency of propagation of the interaction is now not real but purely imaginary. Thus, by analogy, we may describe our interaction as arising from the exchange of massive bosons of imaginary energy, which become essentially massless (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\kappa \rightarrow 0\)</span> ) as the critical point is approached. It is the latter, and hence long-range, character of the induced interaction which leads in the present language (II) to the infrared anomalies and non-Fermi liquid exponents discussed above.</p>
<p>We also note that analogous phenomena arise in particle physics under similar circumstances when a gauge boson becomes massless. Thus, even Thomson's electron in free space interacting with the massless photons is not expected to propagate as a free particle at very long times and long distances (Karanikas et al. 1992). This infrared anomaly, that would appear only over cosmic dimensions, has been found to have related (though not entirely equivalent) counterparts in dense electron systems which may be studied under normal laboratory conditions.</p>
<h4 id="anisotropic-superconductivity-1">6.4 .6 Anisotropic superconductivity</h4>
<p>The pairing potential (23) forms the starting point for an analysis analogous to that of BCS for a superconducting instability. It is instructive to begin with the Cooper problem in which we initially drop the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> dependence of the interaction and hence solve the Schrödinger equation of two particles in a static potential. The problem is simplified by working with the Fourier components of the potential <span class="math inline">\(v_{q}\)</span> and of the pair wavefunction <span class="math inline">\(\psi_{q},\)</span> which is expressed as a product of a 'radial' part <span class="math inline">\(R_{q}\)</span> and an angular part <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\hat{q}}\)</span> where, for the isotropic limit, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{q}\)</span> is a unit vector parallel to <span class="math inline">\(q .\)</span> Note that the spins are in a triplet or singlet state depending on whether <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\hat{q}}\)</span> has odd or even parity, respectively. The effect of the finite range of <span class="math inline">\(v_{q \omega}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is then put in approximately by limiting contributions of the transition matrix element <span class="math inline">\(v_{q-q^{\prime}}\)</span> to values of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q^{\prime}\)</span> within an appropriate range about the Fermi level. We also include the effect of the Pauli principle by restricting transitions mainly to states above the Fermi surface. This leads us to a pair wavefunction and a binding energy which is always finite if the appropriate matrix element of the interaction is negative.</p>
<p>An extension of this Cooper problem to take account of the co-operative effect of all pairs ultimately leads us to the BCS transition temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s }\)</span>. For a representation defined by <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\hat{q}}\)</span> for which binding occurs, we then find in the weak coupling limit <span class="math display">\[
T_{ s } \cong \theta \exp (-m / g \Delta m)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is a scale set by the finite frequency range of the pair interaction, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the total mass of the quasi-particles, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m\)</span> is that part of the mass which arises from the self-interaction for the potential <span class="math inline">\((23),\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> measures the effectiveness of the pair wavefunction in sampling the attractive part of the pair potential (Millis et al. 1988 ).</p>
<p>In terms of the angular function <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\hat{q}}\)</span> given above this critical parameter <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is defined, in the isotropic limit, as the integral of <span class="math inline">\(v_{q-q^{\prime}} \eta_{\hat{q}} \eta_{\tilde{q}^{\prime}}\)</span> over the solid angles in both variables divided by the same without the <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> functions. Also, we note that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m / m\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C / C\)</span> in leading order in <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s },\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta C\)</span> is given by eq. (20) and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is the total heat capacity of the interacting fermion system. Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is some appropriate average over the relaxation spectrum <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{q}\)</span></p>
<p>We consider first an incipient ferromagnet defined as in the preceding section for <span class="math inline">\(c&gt;0 .\)</span> Then pairing is expected to occur for the spin triplet state, the simplest representation <span class="math inline">\(\left(\eta_{\dot{q}}\right)\)</span> for which corresponds to the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> -wave state. When the correlation wave vector <span class="math inline">\(\kappa=(1 / c \chi)^{1 / 2}\)</span> is well below the characteristic Fermi wave vector <span class="math inline">\(k_{ F },\)</span> we then find that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(1 / 3\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is of the order of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \chi^{-1} k_{ F }\)</span> (Fey and Appel 1980; Levin and Valls 1983 ). As <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> increases, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> tends to fall, and vanishes as the potential becomes essentially local in space where the p-wave function has negligible weight.</p>
<p>It is interesting to consider the orders of magnitude for <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s }\)</span> predicted by the above model. For p-wave pairing in liquid <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3} He , m / g \Delta m\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(3 m /\left(m-m_{0}\right),\)</span> the empirical value of which is approximately <span class="math inline">\(1.5 .\)</span> Also <span class="math inline">\(\theta \sim k_{ F }^{2} \chi_{0} / m_{0} \chi\)</span> is of the order of <span class="math inline">\(0.5 K\)</span>. Thus, eq. (24) predicts a value of a few millikelvin, in order of magnitude agreement with a transition to a triplet p-wave superfluid state observed at approximately <span class="math inline">\(2 mK\)</span></p>
<p>Let us now turn to the analogue of this superfluid state in metals, in which the carriers move in a lattice and are charged rather than neutral. If the expressions for <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He carry over, then for the same <span class="math inline">\(\chi / \chi_{0}\)</span> we might expect <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s }\)</span> to be greater by a factor of the order of the ratio of the nuclear to the relevant electron mass, i.e. by perhaps three orders of magnitude. Examples of p-wave superconductivity of this simple kind have not, however, been unambiguously identified, even in the low-millikelvin regime.</p>
<p>It is worth listing some of the effects which arise in the lattice, but not in liquid <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3} He ,\)</span> which may account for the elusiveness of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> -wave superconductivity. The list would include (i) the non-parabolic and multi-band spectrum of real metals, (ii) lack of galilean invariance, (iii) the pair breaking effects of frozen-in disorder, (iv) the spin-orbit interaction, (v) additional low-frequency branches of the spin fluctuation spectrum, (vi) corrections to the linear response approximation and (vii) further components of the true induced interaction which we have discussed only briefly. Some of these factors could have a deleterious effect on the stability of the form of superconductivity we are considering.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the case of <span class="math inline">\(Pd\)</span>, for which <span class="math inline">\(\chi / \chi_{0}\)</span> is indeed comparable to <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He and for which the starting mass <span class="math inline">\(m_{0}\)</span> may be taken to be the conventional band calculated value, which is nearly three orders of magnitude below that of <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He atoms. The model used for <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He would then lead to <span class="math inline">\(T_{\text {s of the order of }}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(1 K .\)</span> But a parabolic band model provides very poor estimates of the basic parameters, in particular of <span class="math inline">\(c,\)</span> which define <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in the more general expressions above. From the known <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> and estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> from neutron scattering data, as well as from first-principle calculations of the generalised susceptibility (McMullan <span class="math inline">\(1989 ;\)</span> Dungate 1990 ), we find that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m / m\)</span> is in fact much smaller in Pd than in <span class="math inline">\({ }^{3}\)</span> He, despite the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\chi / \chi_{0}\)</span> is virtually the same in both cases. The revised estimate of <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s }\)</span> is now in the low-or sub-millikelvin range and, because of the effects of frozen-in disorder already discussed in section <span class="math inline">\(6.2,\)</span> p-wave superconductivity may be suppressed altogether. Most candidate materials which have been considered theoretically have met with a similar fate from one or another of the effects (i)-(v) listed above. Promising cases not yet investigated experimentally are summarised in section 6.2 (see also Foulkes and Gyorffy ( 1977 ) for a discussion of p-wave pairing in a more conventional BCS model). Also, we do not rule out the possibility that more exotic forms of odd-parity super-conductivity already exist in some cases among heavy fermion f-electron systems and the low-dimensional conductors (Sigrist and Ueda 1991 ).</p>
<p>Finally, we consider briefly singlet pairing for an even-parity anisotropic state of an incipient anti-ferromagnet. For the simple cubic lattice discussed in the preceding sub-section, a plausible representation describes an anisotropy of a 'clover leaf' form with orthogonal positive and negative lobes along the cube axes. For this choice, the parameter <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> increases to a maximum of <span class="math inline">\(1 / 6\)</span> (for <span class="math inline">\(d=3\)</span> ), rather than <span class="math inline">\(1 / 3\)</span> for the p-wave model, as the critical point is approached (Millis et al. 1988 ). We may think of the above configuration with even parity as a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> -wave state.</p>
<p>The exponential factor <span class="math inline">\(m / g \Delta m\)</span> is minimised by approaching the critical point, i.e. the critical pressure <span class="math inline">\(p_{ c },\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(v_{q}\)</span> is typically large and strongly <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> dependent. Thus we might expect the peak in <span class="math inline">\(T_{ s }\)</span> to be found close to <span class="math inline">\(p_{ c }\)</span> if the magnetic transition goes continuously to zero at the critical pressure. This behaviour has recently been observed in a heavy fermion anti-ferromagnet, in which the Néel temperature can be suppressed continously with hydrostatic pressure (Grosche <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. <span class="math inline">\(1996 ;\)</span> Julian <span class="math inline">\(e t\)</span> al. <span class="math inline">\(1997 b\)</span> ).</p>
<p>The possible applicability of anisotropic even-parity models in other systems has already been discussed in section <span class="math inline">\(6.2 .\)</span> The development of a quantitative theory, which accounts both for the appearance of anisotropic superconductivity in some cases as well as for its absence in other materials of a similar kind, remains an outstanding unsolved problem.</p>
